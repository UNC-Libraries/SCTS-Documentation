## Processing Note and Revision Statements

### Processing Note

- <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Finding%20Aids%20in%20ArchivesSpace.md#processing-information">ArchivesSpace documentation</a>
- See boiler plate processing statements in [Descriptive Elements](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Descriptive%20Elements.md#processing-information).
- Rememeber to update this note when adding [additions](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Additions.md#adding-revision-statements-to-processinfo-in-archdesc). 

### Revision Statements

- Create a new Revision Statement when making revisions to existing finding aids, including [additions](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Additions.md#adding-revision-statements-to-revisiondesc-in-the-eadheader).
- <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Finding%20Aids%20in%20ArchivesSpace.md#revision-statements">ArchivesSpace documentation</a>


## Restrictions

- [ArchivesSpace documentation](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Finding%20Aids%20in%20ArchivesSpace.md#restrictions-to-access)

- Check control files and ArchivesSpace. 

- Note at every level—collection, series, and container. 

- Remove outdated restrictions and “This collection contains unprocessed…” (if applicable). 

- Word consistently and explicitly. Use boiler plate restriction statements found in [Descriptive Elements](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Descriptive%20Elements.md#restrictions)

- Restrictions to Access statement for A/V: **Use of audio or moving image materials may require production of listening or viewing copies.**

## Separated Materials

<a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Finding%20Aids%20in%20ArchivesSpace.md#separated-materials">ArchivesSpace documentation</a>

- Include all materials housed separately in the stacks and stored digitally. 

- For additions: Check existing numbering to make sure you start with the correct number. 

  - **Audiocassettes (C-05700/1-84)**
  - **Image Folders (PF-05723/1-/376)**
  - **Photograph Albums (PA-00613/1-19)**
  - **Oversize paper folders (XOPF-3824/1, OPF-3824/2-3)**
  - **Digital folders (DF-40283/1-20)**

## Abstract

- [ArchivesSpace documenation](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Finding%20Aids%20in%20ArchivesSpace.md#abstract)

- Include contextual information in the first sentence of the 520 abstract, as appropriate. 

- Include ethnic and racial identities for creator(s), collector(s), and major figures documented in collections so that whiteness is no longer the presumed default of the people represented in our collections. Consult the [Style Guide](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Style%20Guide.md) for a list of recommended ethnic and racial identities. 

- For additions: add information to abstract, as needed. 

- Conscious editing: When appropriate, re-frame the abstract narrative to surface and emphasize the lives of those historically left out of our description. Consult [Principles for Ethical Description](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Principles%20for%20Ethical%20Description%20in%20Special%20Collections%20Technical%20Services.md), [Style Guide](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Style%20Guide.md#abstracts-collection-overview-bioghist-notes), and [Descriptive Elements](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Descriptive%20Elements.md#scope-and-content-note-and-abstract) for further information. 

# Agent and Subject Headings

- [ArchivesSpace documentation](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Finding%20Aids%20in%20ArchivesSpace.md#agent-links)

- Be sure to include a heading for the creator. If the creator is also a subject, make sure to link the name twice (once as a creator and once as a subject).

- End with a period, with at least two exceptions: 

  - Open-ended dates, e.g., **Davis, Angela Y. (Angela Yvonne), 1944-** 

  - Information in parentheses, e.g., **Guitar music (Blues)**
 
# Finding Aid Status

Make sure the finding aid status is set to "Completed."

# Publish Checkboxes

Make sure "Publish?" checkboxes are checked as appropriate (this is the first thing you should check if you can't see information when you preview your finding aid).

# Capitalization and Punctuation

## Series titles

- End with a period.

- Use title capitalization: **Series 2. Financial and Legal Papers, 1685-1887.** 

- Style for series titles in additions:  **Series 3A. Annual Reports, 1921-1922 (Addition of 2016).** 

- If the collection consists of only one series collections, the series title is the same as collection title and the series is not numbered. 

## Unittitles

- No ending punctuation.

- Use commas, not colons, before dates.

- Use sentence capitalization: **Miscellaneous short writings, 1856-1857 and undated


# People and Place Names

## People

- Choose one form of a name and use it consistently throughout the finding aid. 

## Places

- Where proceeded by city or county, use appropriate abbreviations: **She was born in Birmingham, Ala.** 

- Put commas around the abbreviated state name: **She stopped by Oxford, Miss., on her way to Los Angeles, Calif.**  

# Spell check

Unfortunately, there isn't a spell check function in ArchivesSpace. You might want to paste notes into another program to check spelling.

# Preview

Use pipette-qa (https://finding-aids-qa.lib.unc.edu/) to preview your finding aid before making it go live.
