# Arrangement

When assigned an accession containing archival audiovisual materials, consult with the AV Archivist about how to best arrange the materials. It is crucial to have an arrangement plan in place before proceeding with item-level processing. Sometimes an arrangement plan is predetermined by the curatorial unit, but often determining an arrangement plan requires some of your own digging and gaining some familiarity with the collection materials. Before diving in, it's helpful to remember that the process of making an arrangment plan for archival AV doesn't vary much from the processes of our manuscript and visual processing collegaues and friends. We often live in a more item-level world when processing AV, but the general methods, practices, and goal of arrangment are the same accross formats - or rather, how can we best present these materials so people can find what they need. 

Generally, try to arrange AV materials by content, rather than by format. Exceptions to this may include production-heavy collections with defined works, or titles, that may benefit from having sub-groupings of like-format items in order to gain a sense of the creator's production process. An example of this includes the Tom Davenport Papers, http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20025   

It's also helpful to remember that archival AV items are non-circulating materials. Or rather, access to all archival AV materials requires an intervention of sorts - in-house or external digitization and the production of a viewing or listening copy that is either delivered on physical media to a patron, or more ideally, is streamed via the online finding aid. This distance grants us some freedom to present archival AV materials in a meaningful or helpful way on our online finding aids that is not inhibited by the physical materials, which are often stored by like formats across collections and collecting units. In other words, we can present materials intellectually by original order or mixed-format groupings and also store the materials in preservation friendly groupings and conditions.

Below are examples of arrangement methods of AV materials and when to use them: 

### Orignial Order:

When most of the materials have an existing original order, try to preserve this order. Original order can be identified with curatorial guidance, by obvious or visible original numbering schemes, published discographies, or from supplementary documentation provided by the creator and/or donor. Collections with original order often include record label collections, production-heavy collections with various formats and elements, project based collections, and more generally, collections compiled by the creators themselves. 

**Examples:**

Apollo Records Collection [arranged by record label issue #], http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20539/ 

Peter Lowry Collection [subseries 2.1.1 arranged by the creator's numbering system], http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20017/ 

### Chronological:

If you are dealing primarily with an event or program-based collection, including live performances and radio programs, or a collection that only has materials produced by a single creator, consider using chronological order. Chronological order only works as an arrangement method if most of the items have a date associated with them. If most of the materials in an event/program based or single-creator collection do not have any apparent dates, consider using alphabetical order to group like-events or programs by title.  

**Examples:**

McCabe's Guitar Shop Collection [live shows arranged chronologically by format], http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20511/ 

FolkScene Collection [series 1 consists of radio programs arranged chronologically by production date], http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20517/ 

### Alphabetical:

Use alphabetical order when original order or chronological order are not immediately apparent, or used consistently across the collection. If you are dealing primarily with performer-based recordings, alphabetize by performer’s last name. If you are dealing with event or program-based recordings, alphabetize by program or event titles, when apparent (ex1. Newport Folk Festival, Odetta ; ex2. Newport Folk Festival, Pete Seeger). 

**Examples:**

Greenhill Family/FLi Artists/Folklore Productions Collection [series 3 arranged alphabetically by artist or event], http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20542/ 


# Formats/Container Types

If you need assistance identifying AV formats, consult the Audiovisual Archivist. A great online resource for identifying AV is the Preservation Self-Assessment Program's Collection ID Guide:

Below is a guide for AV format description for the Jitterbug database (green), as well as for finding aids (orange).

# Labeling and Putting Stuff Away (Work in Progress!)

_This section is a work in progress...stay tuned!_

## Rehousing Materials

Apart from moving image film, it is preferable to leave audiovisual materials in their original containers since these containers often contain information about the original stock, as well as container notes created by the creator or donor of the collection. Exceptions to this include original containers with severe preservation concerns, such as mold or an inability to properly contain the item at hand.  

Whenever an audiovisual material is rehoused, transcribe all titles and container notes from the original container into Jitterbug and photocopy or digitally photograph the original container. Place the photocopy or photograph in the collection’s control file or SFC’s Department Drive until proper procedures for documenting original containers are developed.  

Unlike audio and video formats, all moving image film is hand inspected, placed onto archival cores, and rehoused into archival cans. Consult the Audiovisual Archivist about film inspection and rehousing before proceeding with moving image materials.  

## Labeling

#### Create Small Item Labels

Once you have retrieved the correct call numbers, see “How to Create Item level AV Labels.docx” (_Louis\Southern Folklife Collection\Departmental Documents\Documentation\Archival Processing \How to Create Item Level AV Labels.docx_) and create labels using foil-back spine labels supplied by Technical Services.  

#### Physically Label Items

Labels for cartridge-based items, such as audiocassettes and videotape, are placed on the spine, while labels for open reel and audiodiscs, are placed on the top left front of the item. Labels for moving image film are created with the label maker located on level 10. More on label type and placement below.

#### Cartridge-based Item Labels

When possible for cartridge-based items, place item labels on the spine of the container. Cut labels to size when appropriate.

Videotapes used as audio 

#### Film:

# XML/EAD

All AV materials are coded at the item-level - even materials that span multiple tapes or reels.  

Below is information on how to code an AV item at a minimum and moderate level. 

## Minimum (Required):

```
<did> 

<container type="container type">Call Number</container> 

<unittitle>Title</unittitle> 

<physdesc> 

<genreform>Format</genreform> 

</physfacet> 

</did> 
```

## Moderate:

```
<did> 

<container type="container type">Call Number</container> 

<unittitle>Title</unittitle> 

<physdesc> 

<genreform>Format</genreform> 

<extent> Reel Size (audio) / Duration (video) / Length in feet (film)</extent> 

</physfacet> 

</did> 
```

Below are examples of how to code an audio, video, and film item when additional information is available. In general, try to keep description at a minimum.
