# Arrangement

Archival papers and records are usually accessioned in groups called collections. Collections often divide into logical units of some sort, but the depth of our arrangement work largely depends on use. As such, we begin with a "first pass," which involves no arrangement.  

- **First Pass** (description of) 

- **Series/File:** If we decide to arrange a collection into smaller units, we want to establish a framework that will enable the researcher to see the various parts of a collection without losing sight of the whole. The parts are usually established as series, which may be further divided into subseries. Keep in mind, there is no rule that says you must have series. There are times, particularly with small collections consisting chiefly (but not necessarily exclusively) of materials of one type or format, you can simply list the files. Increasingly we do this with larger collections too, when the groupings are more like large files than holistic, self-contained series.
