## What to Send to Conservation

If it’s unclear whether something should come to conservation, send the Senior Conservator 
(Adrienne) a Teams message to ask questions.

If it can be safely processed or housed by TS-Archival but may not be perfectly stable for reading 
room use, it generally does not need to come to Conservation right away. It can be routed to 
Conservation through another use-driven workflow: exhibits, digitization, or research room / class 
use.

Send materials that...
 - Cannot be safely processed by TS-Archival
 - Cannot be safely housed by TS-Archival, including oversized items that need a custom 
housing
 - Need to be unframed
 - Are being called out specifically in the finding aid, so anticipated use is great, and cannot be 
safely used in the reading room 
 - Are moldy or appear to have active pest infestations
   
If a damaged page is part of a larger document, the whole document (including undamaged pages) 
can be routed to Conservation so it can be housed as one unit. 

## How to Send It to Conservation Services 

 - TS-Archival uses individual account to create Aeon transaction for the item
   - If there is not a preexisting record for the item to use to generate the Aeon request, 
create a placeholder record
   - Aeon placeholder records for Archival materials may include: collection number, 
accession number, brief description of what’s being sent and quantity (i.e. 1 rolled 
item, 10 framed items, etc.)
   - Staff may need to use reading room to complete the transaction and print slips
  
 - TS-Archival prints Aeon slips
   - ½ of the Aeon slip stays with the item
   - If the item is processed, the other half goes on the shelf where the item would be
   - If the item is not processed, the other half stays in the folder on the shelves next to 
the vault, or with the materials in the processing room

 - TS-Archival staff completes a conservation form (located on the shelf above the Level 9 conservation cart)

 - TS-Archival places item on cart on level 9
   - Change location in Aeon to “In conservation review area (9)”
   - If the item is a vault item, or there are too many items to fit on the cart, TS-Archival 
contacts P&CS staff to coordinate getting items to the lab

- P&CS picks up items from carts on the first and third Mondays of each month
