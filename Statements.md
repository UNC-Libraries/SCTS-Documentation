Folder titles were derived from original folder names and from descriptive metadata found within the files by the processing archivist.

Paper files have been rehoused as received, with some folder titles and subject groupings of loose materials, such as Awards and 
Certificates, created by the processing archivist.


# Ethical Description

## Ethnic Identities Statement
*Listed under Processing Information*

Since August 2017, we have added ethnic and racial identities for individuals and families represented in collections. To determine identity, we rely on self-identification; other information supplied to the repository by collection creators or sources; public records, press accounts, and secondary sources; and contextual information in the collection materials. Omissions of ethnic and racial identities in finding aids created or updated after August 2017 are an indication of insufficient information to make an educated guess or an individual's preference for identitiy information to be excluded from description. When we have misidentified, please let us know at <wilsonlibrary@unc.edu>.

## Misc. Processing Information Statements

**Example: [Nancy Hamilton Collection](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20125/)**

Little is known about Nancy Hamilton and her connection to the recordings found in the collection. The interview recordings may be related to the This is Carolina radio program (found in the Department of Radio, Television, and Motion Pictures of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Records #40086) or loosely related to Unto These Hills, an outdoor historical drama which was presented each year in Cherokee, N.C. Materials related to Unto These Hills reside in the North Carolina Collection and are accessible through the university libraries catalog.
