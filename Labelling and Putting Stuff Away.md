# Creating locations in ArchivesSpace

_Updated May 2020_

## Why keep track of locations?

In brief, recording locations allows staff--especially Research and Instructional Services staff--to locate collection materials in the stacks when patrons request them. Because collections are not shelved alphabetically or in call number order, it is impossible to browse for most material in the stacks. Using the locations table is the only way to find most materials in the stacks. 

## Formats and Additions

Many collections contain material in several different formats--folders of paper, photographs, oversize materials, audiotapes, videotapes, film, etc. Generally, each format is shelved in a different location in the stacks to maximize shelf space and to aid in preservation. Sometimes additions to collections are also housed apart from the original deposit even if they contain the same type or format of materials. Because additions are often acquired over many years, they are usually shelved wherever shelf space is currently available. 

With so many collections and so many formats dispersed throughout the stacks it is ESSENTIAL that we carefully track the exact location of all collection materials in ArchivesSpace! 

> NOTE: For right now, you can use ArchivesSpace to look for locations for circulating materials ONLY, which is why you won't see location information in ArchivesSpace for materials such as audiotapes, floppy discs, or videotapes! Those materials have their own spreadsheet, which lives in G:\wilson\TS\non circulating locations\non_circulating_locations.xlsx. 



<!-- It works best if you open Access first, and from Access open the Location Database. -->

<!-- The database lives in G:\wilson\RI\Databases_and_shortcuts\archival_locations_restored -->

<!-- ## Deciphering the Database

<!-- With so many rows and columns and so many peculiar numbering schemes, the database can seem confusing. Be not afraid. The example and instructions below will guide you through the database madness. -->

<!-- Each database field is described in detail below, including the purpose of each field, the type of information it should contain, and the way you should format data in each column. As you will see, some fields are more complicated than others. All of these column names use terminology from the Archivists' Toolkit, sometimes this is confusing. -->

<!-- For materials in records cartons or document cases, each box is tracked in a separate row in the database. Yes, this is a lot of data entry. -->

<!-- ## Resource ID -->

<!-- The Resource ID column records the collection or record group number as a 5-digit number. (Add enough zeroes to make it 5 digits: 00234, for example.) You will enter the collection number for your collection every time you create a record (row) in the database. The Resource ID field can be sorted numerically to group all entries for a single collection together. This is helpful when you want to see all of the materials and formats for a collection together in one place. -->

<!-- ##  A note on H1 and H2 -->

<!-- This system is based on the idea of having numbered folders in numbered boxes, but can be adapted to most any of our locations situations. -->

<!-- H1 stands for Hierarchy 1. H1 represents the container that is NOT listed in the finding aid. In the H1 columns, we record the information about the boxes in the box/folder scenario presented above. If you only have boxes and no folder numbers, you will record the information about the boxes to the H2 columns and record "Blank" in the H1 columns. -->

<!-- The H2 or Hierarchy 2 columns record information about whatever container is listed in the finding aid. We typically record folder numbers in the finding aid, but not the numbers of the boxes that they live in. Information about the folders would go in the H2 columns. -->

<!-- The H2 fields are never blank. If, for example, there are box numbers in the finding aid, record information about the boxes in H2 and leave the H1 columns blank. -->

<!-- ### H1_Label -->

<!-- The H1_Label column is for the container type (document case, record carton, oversize box, etc). If you do not have the double hierarchy (i.e. folders in boxes) you can record a "Blank" here. These values are constrained to a list. If you need to add a new label, see Jackie. -->

<!-- ### H1_Value -->

<!-- The H1_Value column records the container number. It will never be a span. Each container gets its own row in the database! If you do not have the double hierarchy (i.e. folders in boxes) you can record a "Blank" here. -->

<!-- ### H2_Label -->

<!-- The H2_Label column records the container type of whatever container is listed in the finding aid. This column will never be blank. These values are constrained to a list. If you need to add a new label, see Jackie. -->

<!-- ### H2_Value_1 and H2_Value_2 -->

<!-- These columns designate the range of container numbers. It will ALWAYS be a span--even if there is only one folder or box. Simply repeat the number in both columns. -->

<!-- If your H2 label is a records box or document case, only record one box per line. DO NOT record a span of record boxes of 1 to 2. The span will be 1 to 1 in one line, and then 2 to 2 in the next line, and so on. -->

## A note on the set-up of the Wilson Stacks

The stacks are divided into color zones and lettered sections within those zones. Each row of shelves is identified by a color, a section letter and a range number. For example, Red U.11. Further, each row of shelves has two sides (side a and side b) and each individual shelf is numbered in sequence. Using the example above, a location might be Red U.11 a.2 (in other words the "a" side of "Row 11" and the second shelf on that side). Most shelves have identifying labels. If you shelve materials on a shelf without a label, find the nearest shelf with a label (usually the top shelf, or a shelf at the end of the range) and count up to your shelf number. This shelf numbering scheme will make more sense when you shelve your first collection. 

It's always a good idea to take a pencil and notepaper into the stacks when shelving collections, or bring a phone to take pictures of the boxes you are shelving. 

### Building

For the time being, assume that all of the collections you'll be dealing with will be stored in Wilson, although we do have some collections stored at the Library Service Center (LSC) in Durham.

### Floor

Which floor is the container on? Typically 3, 5, 7, 9 or 10. 

### Room

The color zone indicated by signage in the room: Red, Orange, Blue, Yellow, Purple, or Green. 

### Area

This column will be an uppercase letter from A-Z, describing an area within the color zone. Check the sign on the end of range to find the area. 

### Coordinate range

This will be a number describing a range within an area. Check the sign on the end of range to find the coordinate range number. 

### Coordinate side

This will be either a lowercase a or b, describing which side of the range the shelf is on. 

### Coordinate shelf

This is a number describing which shelf the container/item is on. 

## Accessing ArchivesSpace

To access ArchivesSpace, go to https://aspace.lib.unc.edu:4433/ and sign in using your Onyen and password. 

## Creating new location information

Let's say you are in charge of shelving the latest addition to the Student Health Coalition Papers (#05649). Once you have shelved the materials and logged into ArchivesSpace, search for the collection using the "Search All Records" box. 

![home_page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62356141/81220617-9a5c2400-8faf-11ea-8515-dd26ac95b06d.png)

Identify the correct resource record for the collection, and then click "Edit." 
> NOTE: Be careful! The correct resource record might not be the first result on the page.


![edit_button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62356141/81222256-fde75100-8fb1-11ea-9da9-ae7532385173.png)

Once the record is open, click on the collection title to give you a fuller view.
> NOTE: You will sometimes encounter this note, especially when dealing with large collections: "Oops! We're having trouble fetching this tree. Please try refreshing the page." Just be patient, and it will usually open with no further action needed.

![edit_view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62356141/81226468-e2cc0f80-8fb8-11ea-8b85-375641a80cbc.png)

Now that you can see the entire record in edit view, click on the "Instances" tab on the left side of the screen.

![instances_menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62356141/81226886-89181500-8fb9-11ea-9ea2-d6a836c981be.png)

Once you are in the "Instances" portion of the record, scroll down to the end of the container list and click on "Add Container Instance." 
> NOTE: You can also click on "Add Container Instance" at the beginning of the container list, but you will still have to scroll down to the end of the list.

You will see the following form:

[Add screenshot here.]

### Type

There's a lot of options to choose from, but for right now, always select the top choice, "Mixed Materials."

[Add screenshot here.]

### Top Container

Top containers typically refer to pageable units, such as record cartons or document cases. 

To select an existing top container (such as a shared oversize box), simply search for the record and link it to the resource record. The location of the top container is already recorded in ArchivesSpace. 

[Add screenshot here.]

To create a new top container, 

<!-- ## ID number -->

<!-- The ID number is automatically generated every time you add a record to the database. The number exists only to ensure that each row has a unique identifier in the database. This field can be sorted in order to track the order in which records have been entered into the database. -->

<!-- Example: Doug and Hazel Storer Collection #5231 (with liberal changes, for example purposes) -->

<!-- The sample table below is a snapshot of the (modified, for example purposes) database entries for one collection (Doug and Hazel Storer Collection #5231). Notice that this particular collection contains several different formats of material--folders, images, oversize papers, videotapes, etc. This collection contains more formats--and more database entries--than most collections you will process, but it should help you understand how to shelve your material and how to create location database records for all of the different formats you encounter in your collections. -->

<!-- So, in this (heavily modified) example, let's say that the Storer Collection #5231 includes... -->

<!-- - 3 document cases, containing 71 folders
- 2 image boxes, containing 45 folders
- 1 museum item
- 1 SV volume
- 2 oversize boxes, containing 14 oversize paper folders
- 1 (additional) oversize box, contianing 2 oversize image folders -->

<!-- Some things to note from the above list: -->

<!-- - Only the contents of the H2 columns will be in the finding aid. -->

<!-- - The H1 containers are simply to help us internally, to account for and locate the various parts of the collection. -->

<!-- - For items that have no container, such as SV volumes and museum items, we leave the columns H1_Label and H1_Value blank. -->

<!-- **But... the H2_Label, H2_Value_1, and H2_Value_2 columns will NEVER be blank!** -->

<!-- Resource_ID H1_Label H1_Value H2_Label H2_Value_1 H2_Value_2 area coordinate range coordinate side coordinate shelf building floor room ID number -->

# Labels

_Updated July 2019_

### Box labels include: 

- "One Library" heading with UNC-CH logo 

- Record group/collection number 

- Record group/collection name 

- Folder numbers (if used) 

- Box number 

- Once shelved, hand-write shelf coordinates in bottom-left corner (Example: Red U10b3) 

The current box label template can be found on the G drive at G:\wilson\ts\archival\labels\Box Labels OneLibrary newtemp.  You can overwrite the existing labels so your labels will have the correct information about the collection you're working on.  I don't tend to save changes I make to the labels template, but you can if you want.  Just be aware other people use the template, too, so it might not be the same next time you open it. 

If you need to make more pages of labels in the template, you can copy all the cells on a page, right-click at the bottom of the page, and click "Keep Original Table Formatting" under "Paste Options" in the menu that comes up. 

**Technical alert:** if your copy selection includes the return at the bottom of the page, the closest choice to what you want will be "Keep Source Formatting" and there will be an extra return at the bottom of your new page, which you should delete so it doesn't misalign the page.  I find the formatting symbols tool (the paragraph symbol button on the home ribbon or ctrl+shift+8) incredibly helpful, because it makes all the invisible parts of the document (returns, tabs, spaces, etc) visible and demystifies certain word processor behaviors/formatting problems (but let's face it, not all of them can be demystified).  And don't worry, the symbols won't show up on printed labels. 

The physical labels this template is meant for are foil-backed labels from University Products.  They come in shrink-wrapped packs with pieces of cardboard in the front and back of the stack of labels.  The sheets themselves are unmarked, but there is a sticker on the pack that says "FOILBACK LASER LABELS 6LBL/SH" "SIZE 3"X4"".  If you're still not sure, ask someone if you've got the right ones. 

**Example (Paige box)**
![Example of the finished label on a Paige box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79389853-b20a3480-7f3c-11ea-81ee-c94e8806befc.jpeg "Example of the finished label on a Paige box")

**Example (Hollinger)**
![Example on a Hollinger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79390068-07dedc80-7f3d-11ea-92d2-a87be95b4109.jpeg "Example on a Hollinger")
This example also includes the shelf coordinates in the bottom-left corner of the label. 

If we run out of foil-backed labels, we use packing labels similar to Avery 5164s.  Should you need to use those, the template for those can be found on the G drive at G:\wilson\ts\archival\labels\Box Labels OneLibrary 5164 temp.  It's important to use the correct template because the foil-back labels are different dimensions from the 5164s. 

If you have a box of restricted material, stamp the label "CLOSED" in red and attach an orange "CLOSED. DO NOT PAGE" tag with a binder clip.  You can find these tags in the folder that holds the oversize, z box, and audiocassette labels.  If you need to print more, you can find the template for these in the labels folder on the G drive.  (G:\wilson\ts\archival\labels\Closed Do Not Page Tags)  Orange paper can currently be found in the metal supply cabinet near the 4th floor research room and photocopier. 

![Closed- do not page label](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79390290-6f952780-7f3d-11ea-81fd-726340a6394b.jpeg "Closed-do not page label")

![Closed- do not page box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79390383-95bac780-7f3d-11ea-8beb-fa6cad60a3a4.jpeg "Closed-do not page box")

Other formats require some or all of the above information. 

Other formats also come in different sized/shaped boxes that do not have enough room for a whole box label.  In cases such as this, it is okay to "condense" the label in the template (I usually do this simply by deleting returns), and then trim the label.  My preferred label-trimming method is using an Xacto knife and a straight edge, as illustrated below: 

Before the cut, lining up the ruler:
![Before the cut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79390481-c26edf00-7f3d-11ea-91d9-f6f62db00d64.jpeg "Before the cut")

After the cut:

### The following are some examples of labels on other formats. 

#### Oversize volume (SV-collection number/item number) 

On the box.  We like to do two sides, one on the short side and one on the long side, so the volume can be identified from multiple angles and give us more flexibility when shelving. 

Short side:
![Short side](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79390727-40cb8100-7f3e-11ea-8a94-9142cef7d9c6.jpeg "Short side")

Long side:
![Long side](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79391680-f9de8b00-7f3f-11ea-9578-797f75b20c16.jpeg "Long side")

Please note that these are "condensed" labels as discussed above.

#### Wrapped volume

Here is a wrapped volume (doesn't need a label, just needs unique ID written on it as described in the Physical Processing section). 

![Wrapped volume](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392102-cb14e480-7f40-11ea-9451-e10f9f268100.jpeg "Wrapped volume")

#### Oversized papers, oversize paper folders (see Physical Processing section for more details) 

(OPF-collection number/folder number-) oversize paper folder, items not individually numbered 

Goes in shared boxes, labeled like so:
![Shared boxes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392231-0c0cf900-7f41-11ea-8e35-56f4d80c9d1c.jpeg "Shared boxes")

Example of an oversize folder (OPF):
![OPF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392292-2e067b80-7f41-11ea-8771-ac0afd5e2382.jpeg "OPF")
More details about this in the Physical Processing section.

Template for oversize boxes that hold oversize folders: G:\wilson\ts\archival\labels\Box Labels OneLibrary oversize materials newtemp 

(XOPF-collection number/folder number) map case folder size, items not individually numbered 

![XOPF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392433-60b07400-7f41-11ea-92cd-eee0f67d32a3.jpeg "XOPF")

Let's zoom in a little on the same folder:
![Zoom XOPF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392535-850c5080-7f41-11ea-81e1-05fb9afbfa4e.jpeg "Zoom XOPF")

And here is the label on the mapcase drawer:
![Mapcase drawer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392611-a3724c00-7f41-11ea-8eae-1ca2f471392e.jpeg "Mapcase drawer")

(OP-collection number/item number) oversize paper, individually numbered 
[**IMAGE**] 

(XOP-collection number/item number) map case size, individually numbered 
[**IMAGE**] 

We don't regularly do individually numbered OPs and XOPs anymore.  It is similar to OPFs and XOPFs.  You write the X/OP number on the back of each X/OP, and you write the range of X/OPs in the X/OPF in the lower right corner of the folder.  Depending on the collection, you might also include the X/OPF number.  Please refer to the "Items Separated" section, which was written in the era of X/OPs, and feel free to ask questions. 

#### Audiocassette

Audiocassette (C-collection number/item number) 

On the item and its container. 
![Audiocassette](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392790-f6e49a00-7f41-11ea-92b5-563a4cf09e4f.png "Audiocassette")

Template for shared audiocassette boxes: G:\wilson\ts\archival\labels\Box Labels OneLibrary audiocassettes newtemp 

#### Audiotape

Audiotape (T-collection number/item number) 

On the item and/or its container. 
![Audiotape](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392873-18de1c80-7f42-11ea-8267-140a73ffbc61.png "Audiotape")

#### Videotape

Videotape (VT-collection number/item number) 

On the item and its container. 
![Videotape](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392933-390ddb80-7f42-11ea-9650-146caf1e8dfd.png "Videotape")

#### Film

Film (F-collection number/item number) 

On its container. 
![Film](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392982-5478e680-7f42-11ea-9b99-dc6fa86cced3.png "Film")

#### Photograph album (PA-)

Two options:

![Option 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79393030-77a39600-7f42-11ea-8812-9a89142ea261.png "Option 1")

Or

**Please note, this section is a bit out of date as of July 2019, although a lot of it is still relevant.  For our most up-to-date processing practices, please see the Physical Processing section, as well as the "Labels" section.**

## Z Style

Many of our items separated formats are housed "Z-style," which is our way of saying that items from several collections are housed in the same container, a la the Z collections. Z collections are collections that have five or fewer folders and are all housed together in document cases. That way we do not have half-empty document cases scattered through the stacks unnecessarily taking up space. The Z collections and Photograph Z folders are housed in collection number order. The rest of the formats that are housed Z style do not need to be housed in collection number order. 

The principle behind housing Z-style is that you find the next available place for your materials in the run of boxes or drawers. Each box or drawer is numbered and this number is recorded in ArchivesSpace. There will also be a place for you to record your item numbers, usually on the lid of the box or the front of the drawer, as a double-check. 

Unlike the three-part item number, the box number or drawer number represents the item's physical location and is recorded in ArchivesSpace, but not recorded in the finding aid. For example, an oversize paper folder may have the item number OPF-2504/3 and be housed in Oversize Box 25. Patrons would request the folder using the number OPF-2504/3. Research and Instruction staff would check ArchivesSpace and see that that particular folder can be found in Box 25. 

![Photograph Zs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79476026-7fad1580-7fd6-11ea-9c91-694eefcdd70b.jpeg "Photograph Zs are housed in order")
![Oversize paper and photograph Zs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79476377-e6caca00-7fd6-11ea-8e75-7cb38a038c3d.jpeg "Oversize paper and photographs are housed Z-style, but not necessarily in collection number order")
![Z contents](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79476565-25608480-7fd7-11ea-9d25-37e76a7bbc8e.jpeg "The contents of the box are recorded on a label on the box lid")

When are photographs filed as a Z collection?

![5 or less picture folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79477514-4a092c00-7fd8-11ea-8717-4a6db741eebb.jpeg "If you have 5 or fewer picture folders, file them with the Photo z run in collection-number order")
![6 or more picture folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79477725-8d639a80-7fd8-11ea-826e-fa1487652699.jpeg "If you have 6 or more picture folders, place them in a document case(s) or record cartons and file them at the end of your collection. Begin numbering the picture box(es) with 'Image Box 1'")

Oversize papers or photographs is our medium size designation for flat items. This designation is for items that are too large to fit in legal folders but small enough that they do not need to be stored in the very large map and print folders. Oversize papers or photographs can be described as individual items or as groups of items. Regardless, the items live in folders stored in flat, large, grey storage boxes. You may enclose multiple items in each folder, but do not overstuff the folder such that the materials are at risk of injury each time an unwieldy folder is removed from the grey boxes. We house oversize papers and photographs similarly so they are grouped together in our documentation, but do keep in mind that we do NOT mix papers and photographs in the same large grey flat box.  

There are some occasions in which it is not feasible to house the materials in folders, and they can simply live in the large, flat, grey box on their own. In that case, your items will have the designation of "oversize box or (OB-)."

## Labeling individual oversize items

Do your labeling neatly and in pencil in the top right hand corner on the back of the item with OP-0000, where OP is for oversize papers or OP-P-0000 where OP-P is for oversize photographs followed by the collection number. If you are describing your oversize items as a group, you do not need to label each individual oversize item. The label on the folder will suffice.  

## Folder labels


| ![Labeling a folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79478328-44f8ac80-7fd9-11ea-8937-fb963b61c5b3.jpeg "If you have 6 or more picture folders, place them in a document case(s) or record cartons and file them at the end of your collection. Begin numbering the picture box(es) with 'Image Box 1'") | With the fold at the top of the folder, do your labeling on the bottom right edge so that it is easy to see collection numbers as you flip through the folders in the map cases and flat boxes. |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---:|

- Label folders for oversize papers (individually described) with OP-0000, where the OP indicates oversize papers and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label folders for oversize papers (described as a group) with OPF-0000, where the OPF indicates oversize paper **folder(s)** and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label folders for oversize photographs (individually described) with OP-P-0000, where the OP-P indicates oversize photographs and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label folders for oversize photographs (described as a group) with OP-PF-0000, where the OP-PF indicates oversize **photograph folder(s)** and is followed by the collection number.  

Number the folders according to how many are in each run (e.g., #1 of 1; #3 of 6). Restricted items should be isolated in their own folders. Stamp or write "RESTRICTED" in red on folders that contain restricted items in a clearly visible place near your other labeling.  

![Example of oversize folder with individually described items](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79479438-c0a72900-7fda-11ea-9ad8-60a2cd29f2db.jpeg "Example of oversize folder containing individually described items; note that the '1-3' in OP-5600/1-3 means that this folder contains the individually numbered items, 1-3.

![Example of oversize folder with items described as a group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79479865-6195e400-7fdb-11ea-858e-1adbd2a91720.jpeg "Example of oversize folder containing items described as a group the 'F' in the prefix OPF differentiates these from the individually described items.

![Example of oversize folder with individually described items 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79480048-973acd00-7fdb-11ea-8e03-df2c80008921.jpeg "Example of oversize folder containing individually described items ")

## Housing oversize materials

Instead of separate runs for boxes of oversize folders (OPs), boxes of oversize photographs (OP-Ps), and boxes with other items, such as oversize photo-albums housed in the large flat boxes, these all live together in the same run. Collections are not housed in numerical order in this run; locations are tracked in the location table.  

> Note: There are three sizes of flat, gray boxes. The 16" x 20", 18"x24" (a.k.a. Jackie's Redemption) and the 2' x 3' (a.k.a. Jackie's Folly). We no longer order the 16" x 20" size, but from time to time they appear. All three sizes are represented with same container type (OP, OP-P, OB); in the finding aid, we do not distinguish among the three. The Folly boxes are better for lighter materials since they are difficult to maneuver on and off of the shelves.  

## Oversize papers in folders

| ![Oversize papers in folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79480514-2e078980-7fdc-11ea-925a-7a7f0a10191e.jpeg "The flag indicates that there is room for more folders") |  With the fold at the top of the folder, do your labeling on the bottom right edge so that it is easy to see collection numbers as you flip through the folders in the map cases and flat boxes. |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---:|

## Oversize photographs in folders

| ![Oversize photographs in folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79493101-fc4bee00-7fee-11ea-8e60-d0f895d0fe12.jpeg "The stickers on box 71 and 89 indicate that they are oversize photograph boxes") | As with the oversize papers in folders, we want to fill an oversize photograph box before moving to the next. We put an indicator on the last box of oversize photograph folders. You should fill up that box before a new oversize photograph box is started. Just like with oversize papers, we can intermingle collections of oversize photographs in folders.  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---:|

## Oversize items not in folders

These should get their own box(es). Loose items from different collections, e.g. posters not in folders, should not be intermingled with items from other collections.  

## Putting folders in boxes

Boxes should only hold six to eight folders. If they have too many folders, it's difficult for Research and Instruction staff to flip through to find the folders they need to retrieve. Record the collection number on the sticker on the box's lid; the box number should also be recorded on the sticker. As a double-check, record the box number on the folder.  

![Sticker on top of box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79481145-17adfd80-7fdd-11ea-9805-e4fcbecec005.jpeg "The sticker on the top of the box includes the box number and lists all the collections housed in that box")
![Box number on folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79481279-41ffbb00-7fdd-11ea-9341-b3a7c841c031.jpeg "The box number is also recorded on the folder")

## Making a new oversize box

Pre-printed labels for new boxes can be found in the green folder on the supplies table in the TS archival processing room.  

There are sticky labels for recording collection numbers on the lid and "Photographs" labels for boxes with photographs.  

## Extra-oversize papers or photographs (X-OP, X-OP-P-)

![Map cases](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79481921-1df0a980-7fde-11ea-835f-6013ca7edd89.jpeg "Map cases")
![Map case drawer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79482049-437db300-7fde-11ea-96be-4258853881de.jpeg "Map case drawer")

The extra-oversize designation refers to our largest papers and photographs. These live in very large folders (typically called map and print folders) in map case drawers. Like oversize papers and photographs, extra-oversize papers or photographs can be described individually or in groups. Note that these materials are quite awkward for our Research and Instruction staff to page, so it is important to describe them thoroughly in the finding aid.  

The extra-oversize designation is a relatively new development in the history of oversize papers at the SHC. In the past, all oversize papers were numbered OP-0000/n, regardless of whether they were housed in the grey boxes or in the map cases. A filing system and a coded list of oversize papers with Series A (map cases) and Series B (grey boxes) assignations steered Research and Instruction staff to the location of the item. This system became increasingly unwieldy and is superseded by the OP/XOP runs.  

## Labeling extra-oversize items

Do your labeling neatly and in pencil in the top right hand corner on the back of the item with XOP-0000, where XOP is for oversize papers or with XOP-P-0000 where XOP-P is for oversize photographs followed by the collection number. As with oversize papers or photographs, if you are describing the the items as a group, you do not have to label each individual item. The folder label will suffice.  

## Labeling extra-oversize folders

| ![Labeling a folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79482194-7e7fe680-7fde-11ea-8fc2-6b306311fb0e.jpeg "Labeling a folder") | With the fold at the top of the folder, do your labeling on the bottom right edge so that it is easy to see collection numbers as you flip through the folders in the map cases and flat boxes. |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---:|

- Label map case folders for extra-oversize papers (individually described) with XOP-0000, where the XOP indicates extra large oversize papers and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label map case folders for extra-oversize papers (described as a group) with XOPF-0000, where the XOPF indicates extra large oversize paper **folder(s)** and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label map case folders for extra-oversize photographs (individually described) with XOP-P-0000, where the XOP-P indicates extra large oversize photographs and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label map case folders for extra-oversize photographs (described as a group) with XOP-PF-0000, where the XOP-PF indicates extra large oversize **photograph folder(s)** and is followed by the collection number.  

The collection creator is added under the collection number. Number the folders according to how many are in each run (e.g., #1 of 1; #3 of 6). Restricted items should be isolated in their own folders. Stamp or write "RESTRICTED" in red on folders that contain restricted items in a clearly visible place near your other labeling.  

![Example of oversize folder with individually described items](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79482570-036b0000-7fdf-11ea-8253-2a66dfa4ee03.jpeg "An extra-oversize folder containing individually described papers; note that the '1-3' in XOP-5600/1-3 means that this folder contains the individually numbered items, 1-3.

## Separated volumes (SV-)

![Separated volumes](https://github.com/athomp4105/In-Progress/issues/70 "This volume fits into a legal size folder and can be housed in a document case or records center carton. It will NOT be treated as a separated volume")

Any volume that cannot be foldered and housed in document cases or records center cartons is a separated (SV) volume. Separated volumes should be marked clearly with SV-0000/n, where SV (for separated volume) is followed by the collection number and the individual volume number. Some separated volumes have custom boxes, but most are wrapped in alkaline paper and tied with linen tape to keep out dust and reduce abrasion. Separated volumes that likely will be used frequently may sit naked on the shelf because frequent use prevents dust from settling for too long on the volume. Separated volumes that are too large for wrapping or not valuable enough for custom boxes may be housed in a flat box (more than one volume may be housed in one box) or, as a last resort, sit naked on the shelf. Ask your supervising archivist if you are unsure of the best method to house and store your separated volumes.  

## Wrapping separated volumes

Separated volumes should be wrapped with archival paper. Because these volumes will be repeatedly wrapped and unwrapped, tape is not used. Instead, linen tape is used to keep the wrapping together. However, this does not mean that you can practice your boy/girl scout ties. A simple bow will suffice.  

![Weighted item](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79483653-8b9dd500-7fe0-11ea-80cd-35f78a2944d6.jpeg "Just like wrapping a present...maybe without the weights")
![Step 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490073-50080880-7fea-11ea-9a27-eed6db2bfec4.jpeg "The tying process: step 1")
![Step 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490159-7332b800-7fea-11ea-8192-2a4ffa45eab1.jpeg "The tying process: step 2")
![Finished product](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490352-b7be5380-7fea-11ea-9bc5-76f55429ffc6.jpeg "The finished product")

Write the volume number on the wrapper so that it is clearly visible when the volume is placed on the shelf (typically on the edge of the package). Also write the volume number on the wrapper covering the top of the volume to reduce confusion when the volume is unwrapped and re-wrapped. For restricted volumes, stamp or write "RESTRICTED" in both places on the wrapper.  

![Wrapped volumes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490442-de7c8a00-7fea-11ea-82a5-c46749ebac5f.jpeg "Wrapped volumes")

**Wrapped volumes are labeled on the side so the label is clearly visible when the volume is placed on the shelf; they are also labeled on the top **

## Unwrapped volumes

| ![Unwrapped volumes on shelves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490609-1f749e80-7feb-11ea-86a9-f37336bc74ca.jpeg "Unwrapped volumes on shelves") | **Some volumes are too large or unwieldy to wrap or box. Generally, these are sturdy enough that they should not face too much harm sitting naked on the shelf. You can pencil the SV number on the inside front cover of the volume, or write the number on strips of acid-free paper tucked into the volume. If you have a restricted volume, write 'RESTRICTED' on the strip of paper, do not write RESTRICTED on the volume itself** |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---:|

## Volumes in boxes

Volumes may need the stability provided by a box. We typically have a supply of clamshell boxes that can be used for this purpose.  

![Clamshell boxes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490821-7aa69100-7feb-11ea-971f-d25f86d9a7af.jpeg "10 in x 15 in Clamshell boxes")

![University Archives volumes in boxes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79491123-f3a5e880-7feb-11ea-885a-9794b2a7c875.jpeg "University Archives volumes in boxes")

You can pencil the SV number on the inside front cover of the volume, or write the number on strips of acid-free paper tucked into the volume. If you have a restricted volume, write "RESTRICTED" on the strip, do not write RESTRICTED on the volume itself.  

These boxes will live in the same run as the other oversize materials and are treated in the same manner. See Housing Oversize Materials for specifics on housing volumes in flat, gray boxes.  

## Photograph albums (PA-)

Photograph albums are a special type of separated volume and receive item numbers starting with the prefix PA-0000/1. They receive this special designation because we want to be able to identify all photographic materials in case we have the opportunity to move all of our photographs to cold storage. See the Separated Volumes section for information on how to wrap or box photograph albums.  

## Special format photographs (SF-P-)

Special format photographs such as daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and tintypes receive item numbers starting with SF-P-0000/1.  

![Special format photographs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79491332-4c758100-7fec-11ea-8e6e-0006e491f1ff.jpeg "Special format photographs are placed in an alkaline envelope labeled with the item number; one or two envelopes then go into a small box")

## Audiocassettes (C-)

Cassettes must have cases before they can be housed. Audiocassettes frequently arrive in their own containers and, typically, it is fine to use these.  

Every audiocassette receives an item number starting with C-00000/1.  

![Audiocassette label 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79491633-bf7ef780-7fec-11ea-8c99-072fc45892f7.jpeg "Audiocassettes are labeled on the tape itself...")

## Reel to reel audio tapes (T-)

Audiotapes must have boxes before they can be housed. Audiotapes frequently arrive in their own containers and typically, it is fine to use these.  

Audiotapes receive item numbers starting with T-00000/1, where T (for tape) is followed by the collection number and the number of the individual audiotape.  

![Audiotape labeling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79492042-695e8400-7fed-11ea-9d16-58a05ae90fac.jpeg "Label the spine of the audiotape box but do not label the tape itself")

## Audiodiscs (D-) (a.k.a. records or vinyl)

Audiodiscs should be stored in record jackets. If they have no jackets, place them in alkaline jackets. Audiodiscs receive item numbers starting with D-00000/1, where D (for disc) is followed by the collection number and the number of the individual disc.  

![Audiodisc labeling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79492305-c9552a80-7fed-11ea-8034-0d1dba66b2a9.jpeg "Write the item number in the upper right corner of the jacket")

## Film (F-)

Films receive item numbers starting with F-00000/1, where F (for film) is followed by the collection number and the number of the individual film.  

We decide how to provide housing for film on case-by-case basis. Consult with your supervising archivist on the available options.  

> Note: If a strange and unpleasant odor emanates from the film, you may be dealing with nitrate-based film. If you can detect the unpleasant odor before the canister is opened, **DO NOT OPEN THE CAN**. This film, used between 1915 and 1950, is highly unstable and can be dangerous. If you think that you have nitrate-based film, consult with a supervising archivist immediately.  

## Videotapes (VT-)

Videotapes must be stored in cases. Videotapes typically arrive in their own cases and it is typically fine to use these.  

Label the videotape and videotape case with VT-00000/1, where VT (for videotape) is followed by the collection number and the individual item number.  

You may have to create labels for the tape and the case.  

![Videotape labeling 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79492651-47b1cc80-7fee-11ea-8ad8-7bc19a6b7690.jpeg "The item number isrecorded on the tape itself...")

## Rolled items (R-)

| ![Rolled items](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79492911-b4c56200-7fee-11ea-9d29-6357a37d6226.jpeg "Rolled items") | Rolled items should be marked clearly, starting with R-0000/1, where R (for rolled item) is followed by the collection number and the individual item number. Several drawers at the end of the extra-oversize papers in the map cases have been reserved for items that cannot or should not be unrolled. Consult with you supervising archivist about whether or not to unroll a questionable item |
