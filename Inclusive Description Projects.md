## Terms around intellectual disability, February 2020 

* In response to a remediation request from Research and Instructional Services, we removed the terms “feeble minded” and “mentally retarded” from the [Cameron finding aid](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00133) and replaced it with “intellectual disability.” 

* We made similar changes in the [Joseph S. Reynolds Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/05060): “establish a state school for children with intellectual disabilities” 

* Added a collection-level processing note which indicated the changes in both Cameron and Reynolds.  

* The issue was not universally addressed across all finding aids. The term “retarded” can still be found in container lists for the C. Hugh Holman (04537), Terry Sanford Papers (03531), Daniel H. Pollitt Papers (05498), Office of the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Records (40076).  

* The term “retarded” is also found in the titles of publications listed in finding aids and in the names of organizations listed in finding aids. For example, in the Floyd B. McKissick Papers (04930), “Map showing location of Soul City Company property for the Warren County Association of Retarded Citizens Homesite, May 1979.” We did not make any changes to publication titles or names of organizations in these finding aids. 

* The term “feeble-minded” can be found in the Miscellaneous Papers (00517), and the term “idiot” is found in the Wyche and Otey Family Papers (01608). These finding aids have not yet been remediated. 


  

## [Louise Davis Photographs](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/40500/) (40500-z), January 2020 

* In the abstract, in addition to mentioning that Ms. Davis was the "…the first woman commencement marshal when she graduated in 1937..," information was included indicating that "…enrollment of women students at UNC was strictly limited.," and that the images are unique in part because they "…depict student life on the campus from the perspective of a woman in a predominately male environment." 


  



  

## Revision of what was called the Tunstall Family Letter, fall 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from Research and Instructional Services, we reframed the finding aid to decenter the white male enslaver. 

* We renamed the collection the [Mary Tunstall Letter on Enslaved Child Betsy](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/05249) 


  

## Rewriting abstracts for university history figures represented in the SHC, summer 2019 

* Re-wrote abstracts for the following collections related to university history figures including [J.G. de Roulhac Hamilton](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/01743), [William Laurence Saunders](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/02658), [Howard Washington Odum](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03147), [Guy Benton Johnson](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03826). 

* In the Saunders finding aid, the new abstract is now more explicit about white supremacy, the Klan, and lynching. e.g., “Known items related to Saunders’ Klan activities and white supremacist ideology are two letters dated 1871 and 1874 about the murders by lynching of African American men near Hillsborough, N.C., and the failure of an amnesty bill for Klan members to pass in the state legislature.” 

* In the Hamilton finding aid, the new abstract contextualizes Hamilton’s historical research as part of the Dunning School and his SHC collecting. e.g.,  “The papers reflect Hamilton's historical, political, and social perspectives that were brought to bear on his collecting manuscript materials documenting affluent white families of the nineteenth and early twentieth-century American South.” 

* In the Johnson and Odum finding aids, the new abstracts center each sociologist’s work on marginalized people including Black people and people in the Lumbee tribe. e.g., “Project files document Johnson’s sociological research on the Ku Klux Klan, Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, musical abilities of African Americans, African American folk songs and folklore, legend of John Henry, desegregation in higher education, and Gullah Geechee people, culture, and language on Saint Helena Island in South Carolina. Also included are research files related to Johnson’s work on Gunnar Myrdal’s 1944 study of race relations in the United States, An American Dilemma.”  


  

## [Hope Carter Photograph Album](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/P0121/) (P0121), summer 2019 

* Abstract includes descriptions of images of white actor Boris Karloff, in "red-face," portraying a member of Choctaw Nation named Tishomingo. Included wording to clarify these images were taken on a movie set and include images depicting Black actors portraying enslaved people.  


  

## [Charles Anderson Farrell Photographic Collection](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/P0024/) (P0024), summer 2019 

* Described the images from the first public performance of the Lost Colony outdoor drama in Manteo, N.C. on 4 July 1937 as including "…offensive scenes of white actors portraying Indigenous people of the Croatan tribe." 


  

## Revising Maunsel White finding aid, summer 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from the SHC, we rewrote narrative description in the [Maunsel White Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/02234) that asserted in classic Lost Cause fashion that White was a "benevolent slave holder."  

* We also rewrote the abstract to center description on material related to enslaved people. 


  

## Revising J. Marion Sims finding aid, summer 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from Research and Instructional Services, we rewrote the abstract, scope/content note, and the biographical note in the [J. Marion Sims Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00666) that asserted that Sims who had conducted medical experiments on enslaved women was a “pioneer” in the field of gynecology.  

* We also analyzed the collection’s contents to see if there was any content about his experimentation on enslaved women. We did not find any, and we made that absence of information clear. “Sims also discussed the sale of enslaved persons, but the papers do not include any documentation of the experimental gynecological and cancer surgeries he conducted on enslaved women.” 


  

## Revision of the Preston Davie finding aid, summer 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from Research and Instructional Services, we rewrote narrative description in several places in the finding aid for the [Preston Davie Collection](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03406) where the Trail of Tears was described as “Cherokee migration.” 

* We also rewrote the abstract to decenter the colonialism (as much as possible) and to name the Indigenous peoples represented in the collection. 

* We added LCSH for the Indigenous nations and people who are documented. 


  

## Removal of illegal alien subject heading and other occurrences of the term in narrative description, April 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from Research and Instructional Services, we removed all occurrences of the dehumanizing terms “illegal aliens,” “illegal immigrants,” and other variations in the finding aids for [Student Action with Farmworkers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20317) and [Paul Cuadros](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/P0088) 

* LCSH “Illegal aliens” was removed entirely and replaced with subject headings for the people against whom this slur was used.  e.g.,  Mexicans--North Carolina--Photographs.,  

* Abstracts were rewritten to remove the offensive terms, and we reframed portions of the narrative description to center the communities documented in the collections. For example, we replaced “The subjects of the images include the living conditions of the immigrants...” with “Images document community members including farmworkers, poultry plant workers, and school children; cultural and social events and celebrations such as quinceañeras and Fiesta Latina; church events such as a passion play; and public events including a September 1999 meeting of the Siler City School Board, a February 2000 anti-immigration rally led by white supremacist David Duke, and the local response rallies.” 

* The term “illegal” in reference to people without documentation was also removed from the narrative descriptions or unit titles in the following finding aids: [Daniel H. Pollitt](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/05498), [Eli N. Evans](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/05210), [Southern Tenant Farmers Union](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03472), [WUNC](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/40278). The term was replaced by the word “undocumented” except in the STFU in which we replaced an archivist-supplied use of “illegal immigrants” with farmworkers to match the context of the image described. 


  

## Revision of [North Carolina Chapter of Delta Upsilon Fraternity Records](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/40151/), February 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from University Archives and Record Management, we added description to indicate that a photograph album contained racist images of white students in blackface. “Contains photographs of fraternity members in social settings. Includes images of white students wearing blackface at what is likely a Halloween party.” 

* We added the LCSH:  Racism--North Carolina--Photographs. 

* At the time, LCSH did not have the heading Blackface except as it related to minstrelsy. LCSH has now added: Blackface, and that heading should probably be added to this collection’s finding aid and catalog record. 


  

## Julian Shakespeare Carr abstract, late 2018 

* In response to a remediation request that was funneled through University Archives and Record Management, we reframed  and rewrote the abstract for the [Carr finding aid](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00141). The new abstract is explicit about Carr’s white supremacist ideology and contextualizes the historic term of art “race problem.” e.g., “The rhetoric in many addresses reflects Carr’s positions on what he and his contemporaries called "the race problem." In keeping with white supremacy movements in North Carolina at the turn of the twentieth century, Carr defended the institution of slavery, claiming it had been beneficial to the enslaved, and argued for denying full citizenship rights to African Americans. Included are Carr's 1899 speech supporting an amendment to the North Carolina constitution that disenfranchised African Americans and his address at the 1913 dedication of the Confederate monument later known as "Silent Sam" on the UNC campus.” 

* We also did some additional analysis on the addresses and Sunday school lessons series (the part of the collection where the 1913 Confederate Monument dedication speech at UNC is located) and added description about the contents. e.g., “The rhetoric in many addresses reflects Carr’s positions on what he and his contemporaries called "the race problem." In keeping with white supremacy movements in North Carolina at the turn of the twentieth century, Carr defended the institution of slavery, claiming it had been beneficial to the enslaved, and argued for denying full citizenship rights to African Americans. Included are Carr's 1899 speech supporting an amendment to the North Carolina constitution that disenfranchised African Americans and his address at the 1913 dedication of the Confederate monument later known as "Silent Sam" on the UNC campus.” 

* We also included a chronology in the biographical note to lessen the great-man centering of the finding aid. We left the original biographical note in the finding aid, but we indicated that this biographical note was written in 1988.  


  

## Including racial and ethnic identities for creators in abstracts, August 2017 

* Began using "white” as an ethnic and racial identity for individual and families, in addition to "Black," "African American," "Jewish," and other familiar identity terms that we have used for decades in collection descriptions 

* Added to newly processed collections and to legacy finding aids when they are updated  

* Processing note explaining the practice and asking for feedback if we have misidentified. 

* Examples: [Girtus Smith](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/05807), [Price Family of Rutherford County, N.C.](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/05795/), and [William Ferris](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20367/)
