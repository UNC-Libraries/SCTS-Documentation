This page provides guidance for the intellectual work of processing, from first pass treatment to arrangement of series to creation of consistent description for topical materials of continuing interest to researchers.

# Arrangement

Archival papers and records are usually accessioned in groups called collections. Collections often divide into logical units of some sort, but the depth of our arrangement work largely depends on use. As such, we begin with a "first pass," which involves no arrangement.  

- **First Pass** (description of) 

- **Series/File:** If we decide to arrange a collection into smaller units, we want to establish a framework that will enable the researcher to see the various parts of a collection without losing sight of the whole. The parts are usually established as series, which may be further divided into subseries. Keep in mind, there is no rule that says you must have series. There are times, particularly with small collections consisting chiefly (but not necessarily exclusively) of materials of one type or format, you can simply list the files. Increasingly we do this with larger collections too, when the groupings are more like large files than holistic, self-contained series. 

- **Series arrangement statements** 

 - **Alphabetical**

- **Chronological**

- **Original order has been maintained**



# Military papers

When describing an oral history of or a letter written by a soldier, if possible, include the following in the biographical and scope and content notes:

- the regiment in which the writer served

- if the writer was a soldier or an officer

- where the writer was writing from and where he was writing to (if this is a quick processing job, you can often tell by looking at the very top of the letter and seeing where the writer was positionedâ€”which makes you able to say, for example, that he was writing from Virginia, without reading more in depth)

- what places are referenced in the letters or oral history

- what battles are being described

If you are describing the letters in more depth, you can include information about camp life, sickness, death, and other cheerful wartime subjects.
