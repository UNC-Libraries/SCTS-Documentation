# Plantation heading construction

## Guidelines for Constructing Plantation Name Headings Locally


- The heading will contain the name and location of the plantation, with the broader geographical term (i.e., the state in which it is located) being sufficient, e.g.,
   - Buffaloe (Va.)
   - Quitzni (N.C.)
- “Plantation” is not included in the name unless specifically indicated that it was part of the name. If needed, Plantation can be included as a qualifier at the end of the heading, e.g.,
    - Dulac (La. : Plantation)
- In order to avoid conflicts with other named geographic entities, a more specific location can be used, or Plantation can be amended to the heading, or both of these strategies can be employed, e.g.,
    - Saratoga (Buckingham County, Va.)
    - Yeopim (Perquimans County, N.C. : Plantation)
- Unnamed plantations will be given the name of the family that owns it, e.g.,
    - Comer Family Plantation (Ala.)
- Plantations without clear locations?
    - If location can be narrowed down to two states, include both, e.g.,
        - Lake Washington Plantation (La. or Miss.)

## Describing Plantations as Corporate Bodies in SNAC
### SNAC's policy differs slightly and is included here for reference

This proposal serves to solidify a SNAC policy and practice for establishing and describing names of plantations, farms, ranches and the like, as corporate body entities. N.B.: This approach does not align with current practice at the Library of Congress, where the policy is to establish plantations as geographic place names in the LC subject file. An example from the Library of Congress Subject Headings would be [Boone Hall Plantation (S.C.)](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh91005979.html)

The justification for describing plantation names as corporate body entities:

- Plantations were more than a geographic location
- Plantations, as corporate entities, were more than just the houses/landmarks
- Plantations were essentially family businesses, and establishing headings for them as corporate bodies recognizes that, and recognizes that in such a way as to allow relationships between it and other entities (i.e., those enslaved there, and those who enslaved people there) to be demonstrated

### Guidelines for Constructing Plantation Name Headings in SNAC
- The heading will contain the name and location of the plantation, with the broader geographical term (i.e., the state in which it is located) being sufficient, e.g.,
    - Buffaloe (Plantation : Va.)
    - Quitzni (Plantation : N.C.)
- “Plantation” is not included in the name unless specifically indicated that it was part of the name. “Plantation” should be included as a qualifier at the end of the heading, e.g., 
    - Dulac (Plantation : La.)
- In order to avoid conflicts with other named geographic entities, a more specific location can be used, e.g., 
    - Saratoga (Plantation : Buckingham County, Va.)
    - Yeopim (Plantation : Perquimans County, N.C.)
- Unnamed plantations will be given the name of the family that owns it, e.g., 
    - Comer Family Plantation (Ala.)
