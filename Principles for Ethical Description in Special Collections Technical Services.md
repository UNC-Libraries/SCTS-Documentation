# Principles for Ethical Description in Special Collections Technical Services 

We recognize the significance of the language we use and the ways we frame narratives in archival description, and we approach our descriptive work with compassion and care for the people documented in our collections and for the people who use our collections and our descriptive resources. 

- We identify people documented in the archival collections by name, wherever possible. 
- We revise and expand legacy subject access points, especially in visual materials description, to acknowledge the people who are documented. 
- We strive for consistent use of conscious and humane language. We do not use language that perpetuates stereotypes, is offensive, racist, and dehumanizing. 
- We revise legacy description that does not meet these standards, whether it was creator-generated or applied by an archivist.  

We strive to improve discoverability of enslaved, formerly enslaved people, and immediate descendants of enslaved people with more expansive and reframed description around the sources in our collections that document their existence.*

- We re-center people who have been marginalized, dehumanized, and erased in the historic record by revising our legacy description that does not hold enslaving families accountable.  
- We describe and make discoverable all eighteenth- and nineteenth-century collection materials that document the lives of enslaved people.  
- We identify enslaved people by name whenever possible. 
- We remediate biographical information in abstracts and elsewhere to clearly connect family and plantation names with slavery. 
- We create NACO and SNAC records for plantation and enslaving family names. 

We seek to dismantle the white supremacist viewpoint that permeates legacy archival description and to refute Lost Cause mythology with historical accuracy.  

- We revise description that neutralizes hate groups as "civic" or "heritage" organizations or belies lynching and other violent acts documented in collection materials. 
- We seek creative digital solutions, such as alt-tagging, closed-captioning, and transcription, to surface content about underrepresented groups that has been hidden by legacy description practices. 

We seek to serve the communities represented in the collections and in the description by improving the accessibility of the description we write.  

- We compose and edit description to privilege inclusivity and accessibility, especially for people outside the academy.  
- We seek feedback on our descriptive work from the communities, with respect and appreciation of their perspective, time, interest, and engagement. 
- We develop opportunities for communities who seek to participate in creating description of their history and collection materials.  

We approach our descriptive work with a commitment to humility, consistency, and transparency.  

- We bring questions to the ethical description channel or meetings so everyone can understand the issues and engage with them. 
- We use processing notes to document the updates that we make to legacy finding aids so staff and researchers can understand the evolution of description. 
- We make legacy description easily available to staff and researchers. 
- We plan our remediation work so that it is systematic and open to participation of everyone in the department.  
- We create documentation that guides this work. 

We connect our work in TS Archival to the work of UNC Libraries.  

- We participate in CE steering committee's focus groups and case studies. 
- We learn about the work of the CE steering committee and how our work connects to it. 

We engage with the efforts of other archivists and those in allied professions who are speaking and writing about these issues. We recognize and acknowledge the influence that they have on our work.  

- We share readings on ethical description. 
- We report out on webinars, conference sessions, and other professional development and learning opportunities.  

We share our work with the profession so we can receive feedback and develop collaborations.
