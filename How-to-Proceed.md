# Introduction

If you process manuscript collections and archival record groups at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, this manual is for you. How to Proceed was written to be used. It was designed to serve both as a training manual for new staff
and as a reference tool for seasoned hands. Novices are encouraged to read the manual through and to
consult it frequently as they struggle to whip their first few collections into shape. Old-timers may
benefit from periodic review of procedures, but will most often find the manual useful as a ready
reference source.

In these pages, you will find discussions of many of the issues you will
face during processing. We think this manual answers a number of questions quite well, yet, because of
the unique nature of archival materials, there will be many other issues that will arise as you work with a
collection. This manual will not replace conversation and consultation with your supervising archivist.
Please, be guided by the following:

**NEVER HESITATE TO ASK QUESTIONS!!!**

None of the information contained in this manual is writ in stone, although some procedures are firmer
than others. All procedures are grounded in widely accepted archival standards. Some of these
standards, however, are either open to interpretation or not tremendously specific in terms of
implementation. Should major changes occur, you will be notified. Please remember that you are always
encouraged to make suggestions aimed at improving procedures or this manual itself.

## Who We Are

SCTS-Archival processes collections for all five of the Wilson Special Collection Library's collecting units: 

 - **<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/shc/">SOUTHERN HISTORICAL COLLECTION (SHC).</a>** The University began acquiring North Carolina
manuscripts in the 1840s, broadened its policies in the 1920s to seek manuscripts from the
entire South, and established the SHC in 1930. The SHC is a center for research on the South,
with important holdings from all of the southern states. Manuscript collections are private
papers of individuals and families or records of private organizations or institutions. The SHC
preserves letters, diaries, account books, unpublished writings, photographs, audio and
videotapes, and other materials. As a general rule, the SHC does not retain collections of museum items
or of published works. Researchers who use the SHC's materials include historians and history
graduate students from universities all over the world, scholars from a wide variety of other
disciplines, family and local historians, and others.

 - **<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/sfc/">SOUTHERN FOLKLIFE COLLECTION (SFC).</a>** The SFC became a collecting unit in 1986. One of the nation’s foremost archival resources for the study of American folk music and popular culture, SFC holdings extensively document all forms of southern musical and oral traditions across the entire spectrum of individual and community expressive arts, as well as mainstream media production. SFC materials are in many formats, including commercial audiodiscs,
tapes, and compact discs; field tapes and instant audiodiscs; photographs; films; and videotapes.

 - **<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/uarms/">UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES (UA or UARMS).</a>** UA is the official repository for the historically valuable,
unpublished records of both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and the
major administrative offices of the UNC System. Records date from the chartering of the
university in 1789 to the present and include minute books of the Board of Trustees;
correspondence of chancellors, presidents, provosts, and deans; minutes of faculty meetings;
files of academic and administrative departments; reports of faculty committees; and records of
faculty and student organizations. University departments began sending records to The Wilson
Library in the 1940s, originally to the Southern Historical Collection and then to the Manuscripts
Department. In 1978, Chancellor Ferebee Taylor officially recognized University Archives and
Records Service as the archival repository for the campus.

 - **<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/rbc/">RARE BOOK COLLECTION (RBC)</a>.** Although the RBC is primarily...well...a rare book collection, it also includes more than 100 manuscript collections. RBC collections consist of literary and other
manuscripts not relating to the South, as well as collections documenting the history of printing. Among the holdings are materials relating to George
Bernard Shaw, John Ruskin, and other British and American writers of note. Also included are
the records of J. M. Dent & Sons, a major British publishing house, and A. P. Watt & Company,
the first literary agent firm; Latino and Mexican comic book collections; a collecting of printing blocks from the Propaganda Fide Press;  Most of the manuscript collections formerly housed at UNC's Health Sciences Library also belong to the RBC.

 - **<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/ncc/">NORTH CAROLINA COLLECTION.</a>** Like the RBC, the NCC primarily holds published items; however, it also includes more than 30 manuscript collections, many of which pertain to the author Thomas Wolfe.

## What We Do

Archivists are intermediaries between the creators of collections and the present and future users of
those collections. Archivists are charged by society with deciding which portions of the enormous
quantity of papers and records become part of the permanent historical record of our culture. Our task
is to preserve these materials and to make them accessible to researchers who study and tell the stories
of our past. The raw materials of history enter the Special Collections Technical Services (TS) department
in various states of disarray and exit in a more usable form. TS renders materials usable by subjecting
them to "processing": arranging a collection in some logical way; describing the collection’s
arrangement, contents, and research potential so that researchers and staff can find the specific
materials they need; cataloging the collection to provide access points that lead researchers to the
materials they seek; and taking physical preservation measures to ensure that materials survive long
into the future.

A good deal of processing is cerebral--developing an arrangement scheme, writing the description,
selecting access points--but it also entails work that is mundane and most decidedly unglamorous. Tasks
like unfolding, flattening, removing paper clips, annotating, separating, and refoldering are very
common in processing work. As in many other fields, countless hours of behind-the-scenes work go into
making the writing (and reading) of history look easy. From time to time, nearly every one of us in
processing work experiences moments of despair when the amount and detail of work threatens to
overwhelm. When this happens, it may be helpful to remember that the papers we process will soon
become the "stuff" of history. Each one of us is a link in the long chain of knowledge that stretches from
the lives of the men and women who created the materials to the eventual users of the archives ... and,
lest we forget, on to all those generations who will benefit from the insights gained by those users now
and still to come.

## Basic Premises

In accepting archival materials into The Wilson Special Collections Library, we are accepting the
responsibility for preserving the materials and making them accessible to researchers. Processing is
based on a few general premises:

 - Our work is an essential contribution to the collective memory of our culture and society.
Researchers who study and tell the stories of our past, fundamental to our sense of identity and
direction as individuals and communities, can do it well only if we do our jobs effectively.

 - Every collection should be made at least minimally accessible. A collection must have a written
description (finding aid) that gives researchers some indication of what they might find in the
collection, if not pointers to the boxes or folders in which to look for specific materials of
interest. Materials need not be housed in folders or arranged into a comprehensible order
before being used by a researcher, but in most cases they will be, and in all cases a processing
archivist will review an unprocessed collection before releasing it for researcher use.

 - There are no one-size-fits-all processing treatments. We consider each collection’s condition and
perceived research value carefully in determining our processing actions. A supervising archivist
will always be available to assist and guide you as you process collections in accordance with
these premises.

## Overview of Processing

Manuscript collections are wonderfully diverse.

The SOUTHERN HISTORICAL COLLECTION focuses on the South, but it contains information about nearly
every part of the world because southerners have visited or lived in nearly every part of the world.
Within the South there is great diversity--rich, poor, male, female, African American, Native American,
politicians, farmers, housewives, and many others are represented in our collections. Manuscript
collections may contain letters, diaries, ledgers, receipts, sound recordings, pictures, and materials in
other formats. They range in size from one item in one folder to thousands of items in hundreds of
boxes. Some arrive here in file folders, beautifully organized and labeled; others arrive loose in garbage
bags. Because of this variety, there can be few hard and fast rules for processing manuscript collections.
There are, however, standards, policies, and procedures that must be applied with common sense and
flexibility.

UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES includes records documenting every stage in the growth of the nation’s first
state university and its response to local and national issues, from slavery to evolution to freedom of
speech. These records are important not only to researchers specifically interested in the history of the
University of North Carolina but to those interested in any aspect of the history of higher education.
They are also important to current administrators at UNC-CH who need to consider past practices when
making decisions. Records are transferred to the UA in accordance with the University Archives and
Records Management Services General Records Retention and Disposition Schedule, which specifies
what records are archival and what records may be disposed once their retention period has ended.
Even so, records arrive in varying states of order and disorder. Some have been kept in logical file
systems, others have not. Some have been stored and forgotten for many years in attics and basements.
As with manuscript materials, the variety of archival records necessitates flexible and common sense
applications of standards, policies, and procedures.

Processing is typically thought of as arranging, describing, and cataloging. This manual divides processing
into a number of tasks: preliminary research and survey, planning, arrangement, description, and
preservation. While this manual contains instructions on producing abstracts that are used to write
catalog records, hard-core cataloging is not typically done by processors and so is not covered in this manual.

Not every processing project will proceed in the orderly sequence described in this manual. Some tasks
will be undertaken simultaneously or in a different order and not all tasks will be performed for every
collection. When deciding how much to do and in what order to do it, remember that your goal is to
preserve the materials and make them accessible in as timely a fashion as possible. And remember to
consult your supervising archivist for assistance. When you begin to process a collection, you will first
become familiar with the background of the creator of the materials, the history of the collection, and
the materials themselves. You will prepare a processing plan, which you will present to and discuss with
your supervising archivist. Your plan may be modified at this point to ensure that it conforms to our
usual practices and that the projected level of work is appropriate given the research potential and
condition of the collection and the time available for processing. This plan is a working document that
will be reviewed and revised as you process the collection.

You are now ready to implement your proposed plan. You will put the materials into the order agreed upon in your processing plan (with
necessary modifications, of course) and you will complete requisite preservation work. As you work
through the collection, you will take notes on everything, chiefly to record the information that you will
need when you write your finding aid. These notes will also serve to refresh your memory if you are
gone from your project for an extended period of time. They will also provide helpful tracks should
someone need to find materials in your absence or take over your project.

As you process, you will begin constructing the collection's finding aid. It is usually easier to describe the
materials as you go through them, rather than wait until you have everything arranged and then try to
remember what you saw days or weeks ago. In fact, you may write a draft of the biographical or
historical note as soon as you finish your background research and later add any essential information
gleaned during processing. Similarly, it is usually a good idea to write series descriptions as you go
through the collection and make needed revisions, if any, after you have gone through the whole
collection. You can do this directly in ArchivesSpace or in another format such as a Microsoft Word document. As you will see later in this manual, it is usually good practice to write your scope and content
note and abstract last.

When you have finished the draft of the finding aid in ArchivesSpace, your supervising archivist will review it. When
the two of you are satisfied with the draft, you will submit a <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Ticketing.md#blue-sheets-and-merge-requests">Blue Sheet request</a> for your finding aid to be published.

# Preparing to Process

## Preliminary Research and Survey

Getting an overview of your collection and preparing a plan are the first major steps in processing. You
will begin by preparing the plan on the form provided. Throughout the project, you will meet with your
supervising archivist to review and modify this plan as appropriate.

The first thing you need to determine is whether you are processing a new collection or adding to an
already established collection. Additions to established collections will be discussed <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Additions.md">elsewhere</a>; this
section deals primarily with new collection processing as well as information useful when reprocessing.

**Where to Begin**

Before you start processing, you will want to get a sense of the history of both the collection and the
creator of the materials, be it an individual, family, organization, or university department.

  _Administrative History_

When processing a manuscript collection (SHC, SFC, RBC, or NCC), a good place to start the search for
information about the history of the collection is with the paper control file and/or the accession record in ArchivesSpace. Control files often contain
information essential to satisfactory processing: collection descriptions; notes on the original
arrangement of the papers and how they were transferred; a gift agreement noting special conditions of
gift or loan/deposit, access restrictions, and disposition of discards; letters from researchers concerning
the papers; and other material that provides biographical or historical information about the creator.
Information in the control files should also provide a sense of why this particular collection was acquired
and if there is content or items that should be highlighted in the description. You will apply some
information, such as restrictions on access and disposition of dispersals, to your processing plan.
If your collection has restrictions, you will need to determine whether they apply to all or part of your
collection. In the course of processing you will need to segregate restricted material and label it to
ensure that restrictions on use will be clear to R&IS staff and to researchers. In the finding aid, you will
let researchers know what restrictions to expect.

Control files must stay in the file cabinets near the administrative offices, so you may wish to photocopy
some pages from the control file and keep them, along with your processing plan, in the processing
room for ready reference. 

> Control file locations: SHC: Level 7-77; SFC: Level 9-29; UARMS/NCC/RBC: consult curatorial staff

When processing a UA record group, there is no need to consult the control file, altough taking a look at the accession record is still recommended. You will often find basic
information attached to the first box of the transfer. This will include a records transfer form submitted
by the department that transferred the records and a list of the files in each box. You do not need to
worry about donor-imposed restrictions, since the records in UA are public records. A good way to start
familiarizing yourself with the records is to compare the list to what is actually in the boxes. Are folders
labeled consistently? Do you discern an order, or do the files seem to have been boxed randomly? Do
you notice any files that might help you to trace the history of the department?

 _Historical Context_

 To process effectively, you need enough information about the creator of the materials to answer basic
questions about the collection: who, what, when, and where. If you exhaust the possible sources and
still come up empty, the materials themselves become the chief resource. In such cases, it is not unusual
to feel somewhat mystified as to who is who and what is what. Often the mists are at least partially
lifted in the normal course of processing, but you should not feel that you have been derelict in your
duty if you leave some of the investigative work to future researchers.

Usually, some information about collection creators can be found, sometimes without leaving the fourth
floor, but you may need to go further with your background research. How deeply you go will be greatly
influenced by the research value of your collection. Try to get the basics down before you start. More
research can be done later to address questions that arise during processing.
The following are some of the immediately available tools for background research:

 - Control files/accession record: may hold a considerable amount of information on the historical context in which
the papers were generated. Control files often contain newspaper clippings relating to
important persons in the papers and notes written by the curator during negotiations with the
donor. In some cases, donors have supplied information about the creators of the papers they
have given.
   - University Archives and Records Management Services has its own version of control
files, but they are unlikely to provide any information that is not on the records transfer
form and box list that are attached to the first box of the transfer.

 - The online catalog: if the entity you are investigating has been cataloged, this may lead you to
useful information.
   - Remember that you can also search WorldCat and ArchiveGrid for related collections.
     
- Basic printed sources: including the Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, the Encyclopedia of
Southern History, Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, Webster's Biographical Dictionary, The Civil
War Day by Day, Biographical Directory of the American Congress, American Authors and Books,
and A Bibliographical Guide to the Study of Southern Authors.
   - For information on individuals and institutions on the state and local level, be sure to
consult the resources of the North Carolina Collection (NCC).

 - Alumni directories: if the collection's creator was a UNC graduate (the 1924 edition, for
instance, has useful biographical sketches).

 - Online sources: University Library website resources include biographical indexes, newspapers,
encyclopedias, Ancestry Library, American Civil War Research Database, and America: History and Life. Outside of
University resources, Google Scholar, Heritage Quest, and Find a Grave are typically trustworthy,
and depending on the kind of information you are seeking, Wikipedia might also be an
appropriate source. 

**Processing Levels**

In the past, we were much more apt to engage in what is called "item-level" processing. This means that
we would examine collection materials item-by-item and remove duplicates, printed material, and
materials we considered sensitive. We might also make preservation photocopies and routinely wrap
acidic newspaper clippings. We would typically arrange materials in strict chronological or alphabetical
order within folders. While this type of processing is still warranted in some instances, it is not
appropriate for every collection.

In our current approach, we expend our processing resources more strategically. We take a triage
approach to arrangement, description, and preservation. All collections (and all parts of a given
collection) do not need the same level of arrangement, description, and preservation attention. Many
collections can be made accessible without arranging materials into multiple series, refoldering, or
removing duplicates. Part of the beauty of this practice is its flexibility. Should it come to our attention
through patrons or R&IS staff that a collection (or parts thereof) would benefit from additional
arrangement, description, or preservation because it is more heavily researched than was originally
anticipated, we can reprocess to meet revised collection needs. In short, we provide broad, if not always
deep, access to all of our collections in a timely fashion rather than intensive processing for just a few
collections.

Our goal is to make materials usable in the reading room as quickly and efficiently as possible. Since
what constitutes usable is different for each collection, we spend time analyzing the material and
thinking about the most appropriate arrangement, description, and preservation treatment for each
collection. This manual often discusses more intensive processing procedures than you are likely to use
routinely. We do this so that you will know what the possibilities are and how to apply them when they
are necessary. Discussing the collection as it has been received, the perceived research value of the
materials, and the priority level assigned by the curator with your supervising archivist before you start
processing will give you guidance on how in-depth your processing treatment should be.

**The Survey**

Having gained some sense of the administrative history and historical context, you are ready to examine
the collection itself. To survey, you must try to see the collection as a whole. If space allows, spread out
all of the boxes and open them. Scan the papers to get a feeling for their scope and content. Skim. Do
not spend too much time on any one item. Resist the temptation to begin arranging and describing. At
this point, just try to get a picture of what the collection is about.

As you begin to look through the containers, remember to handle the materials gently. Folder labels
often flake off and delicate manuscripts can easily tear. Slowly remove small handfuls of papers; after
examining them, return them carefully to their proper place. Books, bound volumes, photographs,
tapes, discs, and other material in an archival collection deserve the same care.

 _On the Lookout_

Since your survey and analysis of the collection will form the basis of your processing plan, you will want
to look for certain things in the materials as you go along. Look at the processing plan form and see what
elements are needed. Take particular note of the following features of the collection:

**Provenance:** The control file, or the records transfer form, should tell you from whom we received the
papers or records.

 - What person, organization, or office actually generated and/or accumulated the material?
 - Have the papers passed through a series of hands?
 - Check the accuracy of the name given to the collection (collection creator), remembering that,
especially with new collections, the name assigned at accessioning is a preliminary judgment call
and may not reflect the true nature of the papers or records.
    - For example, if you are processing the Hamilton Patton Copeland Papers, check to see if
the papers focus in some way on H. P. Copeland. It could be that a better name for this
collection would be the Copeland Family Papers

UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES: You might discover that there are personal papers of a department
administrator intermingled with departmental records. While this will not change what we call the
group of records, it is something to note. You might also discover that the department that transferred
the records had inherited the records of another department.

**Names:** Look out also for basic identifying information about the collection creator and other major
players in the collection. In particular, take note of essential names and dates.

 - Did your collection creator sign his name Robert Richardson Jones, Robert R. Jones, or simply
Robert Jones?
 - If Robert Jones had a grandfather, an uncle, and a son with the same name (all too common), it
will be very helpful to know birth and death dates in order to distinguish one Robert Jones from
another.
   - If birth and death dates are unavailable, some indication of when the person lived
should be given, even if only in terms of an active date, which shows the years
when the person is known to have been active.

UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES: You may find that the current name of the department that transferred the
records is different from the name reflected in the records. This might be simply the result of a name
change, or it might reflect an administrative reorganization that changed some of the functions of the
department. Always take note of name changes and the dates at which they occurred, if you can
determine them.

**Arrangement:** Observe the arrangement of the materials:

 - Can you discern a purposeful order?
 - Are the materials in file folders?
 - If so, do the folder headings appear to be accurate and meaningful?
 - Are there lists of folder headings at the beginning of a file?
 - Is there an index?
 - Does the collection seem to be in its original order or has someone, either the creator or
someone else, imposed another order?
 - How well does the current arrangement provide access to the information in the papers?
 - Look for related groupings of material. Sets of material are the basis of series and subseries--the
building blocks of every arrangement scheme.
 - Is the current arrangement of the materials usable?
 - If not, what arrangement might be appropriate?
 - If the materials seem to be in no particular order, are there series that you can create to
facilitate use of the collection?

**Content:** As you scan the materials and briefly examine selected items, try to form an impression of
what the collection is about:
 - What are the major subjects and research strengths?
 - How well do the materials document the various aspects of a person's or an organization's history?
 - Is there anything missing?
 - Do some materials seem not to fit with the rest of the collection?
   
**Format and Physical Condition:** These aspects of the materials are almost as important as the content in
deciding what to process and what levels of processing will be used.
 - Are most of the items letter, legal, or oversized?
 - Are there duplicates?
 - Are there photocopies?
 - What condition is the paper in?
 - Is mold visible?
 - Are there peculiar odors?
 - Is the handwriting legible?
 - What formats other than paper are in the collection?
 - What condition are these other materials in?

In addition, you will want to note:
 - Approximate earliest and latest dates of the materials (inclusive dates);
 - Approximate earliest and latest dates of the bulk of the materials (bulk dates);
 - Frequent or prominent correspondents;
 - Major figures and major events in the life of an individual or in the history of an organization;
 - Major occupations of individuals; major functions of an organization; major events and issues in
   the history of the university, such as controversies, the recruitment of minorities, the
establishment of new programs, etc.
 - Towns, counties, or other locations that are well-documented;
 - Confidential or sensitive materials, such as transcripts, medical records, and case files of third
parties represented unknowingly in the collection;
 - Bibliographies, histories, genealogies present in the papers;
 - Languages (other than English).

Retain whatever information you gather; it will be helpful in making decisions about arranging your
collection and will also be useful in processing plan discussions with your supervising archivist.

**Taking Note**

Take notes from beginning to end. Your notes will help you make better processing decisions and will
also help when you write the finding aid throughout but especially at the end of the project. Writing
down information as you see it can save much time later. Use your judgment about how much to write,
but err on the side of taking more rather than fewer notes. Backtracking to locate something you forgot
to note can be extremely frustrating.

Processing notes tend to fall into one of two categories:
 - Content notes: Help in writing the finding aid and in cataloging the materials through name and
subject access points.
 - Sorting notes: Aid in arranging the papers--clues, facts, perceptions, and hunches that might
help in determining a workable order for the collection.
   - Examples include reminders to yourself about locations of individual items in the papers
and hunches about the name the creator gave to a certain file.

Each note, whether content or sorting, should take no more than a sentence or two. You may wish to
write down particularly telling, witty, or otherwise special direct quotations from the papers to spice up
your finding aid, but these should be few.

Leave tracks as you go. Label the boxes, your stacks of material, and your notes. Document your work so
that someone else could carry on in your absence. Leave notes to yourself if you know that you will be
leaving this project to work on another or be away for any extended period of time. Do not lose sight of
the idea that your task at this point is to survey. Pace yourself accordingly. Although every collection is
different, a very thorough overview of a medium-sized collection (10 to 15 record center boxes) should
not take more than a few days; as your experience grows, a relatively small collection may reveal its
salient points to you within minutes.

 ## Writing a Processing Plan

Your analysis of the collection will result in a processing plan. This plan should be completed in
consultation with your supervising archivist. The plan becomes an important document, providing a
framework and continuity for the project. You and your supervising archivist will refer to it regularly and
adjust it as necessary throughout the course of the processing work. You will need to be familiar with
the ideas set forth in chapters 4 and 5 of this manual before you can write a processing plan. As you
read these sections, bear in mind that you will have to make decisions on the following points:

 - **Overall arrangement scheme:** List proposed series and subseries, if any.
   - **Arrangement:** within series and subseries.
 - **Levels of processing for each series:** Should material be arranged to the box, file, or item level?
How much refoldering and relabeling is appropriate? How extensive should you make each
series description (narrative plus folder/file listings)?
 - **Biographical/historical note:** How extensive will it be? What form will it take? How accessible is
pertinent information?
 - **Use of team members:** Optimally, what tasks (refoldering, labeling, etc.)
could less-experienced workers carry out? Approximately how much time should each task
take? Could the project be completed more efficiently if other more experienced processors
were involved? How would they be involved?
 - **Supplies:** Are there any unusual needs for supplies--large numbers of folders (thousands) or
large numbers of boxes (50 or more), or other special needs?
 - **Duration:** How many total hours will the project require? What is a realistic project completion
date?
 - **Other considerations:** Are special indexes or unusually detailed cataloging warranted? Are there
unusual conservation needs? There may have been promises made to the donor (for
photocopies, digitization, etc.), how will these affect the project? What else needs to be kept in
mind as the work proceeds?

The more information you can provide up front, the clearer will be the task ahead. Remember that your
entire career is not riding on how accurately your plan predicts the actual processing of your collection.
The plan is a working document; you should expect changes and modifications to occur. A sample form

 # Arranging

## Basic Premises for Arranging

After survey, analysis, and background research, it is time to consider the collection’s arrangement: Is
there a discernible order? Is the order meaningful? Does it facilitate or inhibit access? A good
arrangement groups together like materials so researchers do not have to look in several places for
closely related things. The arrangement can also reflect the way in which the materials were used by the
creator, thus making the original order important to preserve. Making decisions about arrangement is
the crucial first step in structuring a collection and creating access to it.

In this manual, we have separated the topics arrangement and description, but you will find as you
process that the two functions are very much intertwined. As you begin organizing a collection, try to
picture the finding aid that you plan to write. Doing this forces you to make some tentative decisions
about grouping the papers into series and helps impose some initial order on the collection. Think also
about the materials themselves and about future users.
 
## If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It

When you surveyed your collection, you paid special attention to the order of the materials. A basic
archival principle is "respect pour l'ordre primitif," which is French for "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Maintaining the original order established by the creator of a collection preserves contextual
information that may be important to researchers. The original order itself may also make an important
statement about its creator. Using the original arrangement scheme, moreover, may save the processing
staff valuable time and energy. Retaining the basic arrangement as received, when possible, is part of
the archivist's responsibility to preserve historical documents in as close to original form as possible.
Keep in mind that respect pour l'ordre primitif does not preclude tidying up the materials or adding a
supporting superstructure to aid in description and cataloging.

If no discernible order exists, or if it is apparent that hands other than the creator's have forged an order
that is counterproductive to using and understanding the collection, or if the original order makes the
collection difficult to use, then you must impose a workable arrangement on the collection.

## The Break Down

Archival papers and records are usually accessioned in groups called collections. Collections usually
divide into logical units of some sort. When arranging a collection, we want to establish a framework
that will enable the researcher to see the various parts of a collection without losing sight of the whole.
The parts are usually established as series, which may be further divided into subseries. Keep in mind,
there is no rule that says you must have series. There are times, particularly with small collections
consisting chiefly (but not necessarily exclusively) of materials of one type or format, you can simply list
the files.

As you investigate the contents of your collection, think ahead to the finding aid you will write. The chief
reason for doing this is that each series and subseries offers you an opportunity to describe. Good
description leads to good cataloging. The combination of good description and good cataloging are the
means through which researchers find the materials pertinent to their research. Careful consideration of
what blocks of materials lend themselves to clear description can be of great assistance in determining
how to divide the collection.

A brief discussion of several general arrangement possibilities follows. Remember that while many
collections will fit into a "standard" arrangement, there will always be exceptions and that even the
tamest collection generally contains some materials that just will not fit neatly into your scheme. There
is no one best arrangement scheme--every collection is different in its own way--but generally speaking,
intellectual arrangements trump format arrangements because the former conveys more information
about what is going on in the collection. Oftentimes you will find that your collection requires a hybrid
arrangement that groups material by type, format, activity, and function. Do not try to fight the flow of
the materials. Challenges like these just come with the territory. Remember, you can always resolve
complex and/or unusual arrangements in description.

## Series and Subseries

Most collections of papers or record groups can be adequately handled by series, with or without
subseries. A series is a body of files or documents kept together because of some connection arising out
of their creation or use. A series might be a body of records arranged under a single filing system, or
kept together as a unit because it relates to a particular function or has a particular physical form.
Identifying the series will be straightforward in a well-kept collection, where files arranged as a single
unit constitute a series. In other cases, series must be constructed on the basis of other unifying
characteristics--their genre or form or their relationship to some subject or activity. Thus, series and
subseries may be type or format-based or they may be based on the separate activities or functions of
the creator of the papers, or they may be a hybrid of all of these. Remember that complex arrangements
can always be explained in the description.

Although series can be many and varied, a certain amount of restraint, largely guided by common sense,
should be applied. Each different format of material does not necessarily need its own series. If you
have audiotapes, for example, they might form their own series or become part of a series when they fit
intellectually with other materials or they might wind up in an “other materials” series with other
materials that don't relate to anything else.

The following list shows some standard type/format-based series (along with a few of the many types of
items that may be appropriately placed in these series):

 - correspondence (letters; telegrams; valentines, greeting cards, postcards with substantial
messages);
 - writings (by the creator of the papers);
 - writings by others;
 - organizational records (minutes, proceedings, bylaws);
 - financial material (bills and receipts, bank statements, account books);
 - legal material (indentures, contracts, deeds, wills, case files);
 - subject files (materials grouped around distinct areas of interest to the creator);
 - research notes;
 - clippings (directly relating to the creator or vital to the creator's interests);
 - printed material (pamphlets, circulars, broadsides);
 - other materials (certificates, awards, items from other standard series when there are only a
few items of a given type);
 - pictures (photographic prints, negatives, drawings, paintings);
 - audiodiscs and tapes;
 - films;
 - videotapes;
 - microforms;
 - electronic media;
 - museum items.

This list does not exhaust the possibilities by any means. A series called "Correspondence and Related
Materials" is often the best solution for materials of many types that are best kept in a chronological
run. You may have a series of general correspondence and several series of correspondence relating to
specific topics. A collection that chiefly contains drawings would call for a drawings series; a collection
with a great number of maps would require a maps series.

The following are examples of series lists for actual collections:

<a href="https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/catalog/04963">Edwin Yoder Papers (#4963)</a>

Second, different formats are collected under the cities where the collection creator lived, worked, and
participated in civic life:

<a href="https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/catalog/04968">Don Shoemaker Papers (#4968)</a>

Third, from UA, series are based on the functions or activities of the department that created the
records.

Although university records come to us in a variety of formats, we generally do not use strict
type/format arrangements for them. We do sometimes segregate formats such as audiotapes or
videotapes if the records contain a large number of them. Other files are usually arranged in series that
are based on the functions (or areas of responsibility) of the office or department that created them. A
group of records might be arranged in a single series or in multiple series depending on their volume
and on the number and complexity of the functions to which they relate.

<a href="https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/catalog/40064">Ackland Art Museum Records (#40064)</a>

1. Administrative Files
   
2. Collections
   
3. Programs and Services

Fourth, another UA example shows a hybrid arrangement, with some series and subseries based on
function and some on format.

<a href="https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/catalog/40278">WUNC Records (#40278)</a>

1. Administrative Files
- 1.1 Development and Publicity
- 1.2 Licensing
- 1.3 Facilities
- 1.4 Financial
  
2. Programming
- 2.1 Human Affairs
- 2.2 Listener Mail
- 2.3 Special Events
- 2.4 Station Logs
- 2.5 Audio Recordings

You have an opportunity to describe at each level, if needed. You will not necessarily write a description
for every level. If a series-level description would add nothing to the subseries descriptions, then leave it
out.

For example, in the finding aid for the Edwin Yoder Papers, a series description for Series 1,
Correspondence, explains how the series is organized. No such explanation is needed for Series 2,
Writings, so there is no overall series description for it. In other collections, you might establish a series
and subseries for which it is more appropriate to provide an overall description of the series and list the
contents of the subseries without additional description.

**Sequence of Series**

It would be grand to have hard and fast rules governing the sequence in which series and subseries
appear. However, collections contain such a wide variety of materials and types of materials are of
varying degrees of significance within collections, so no predetermined order would be satisfactory in all
cases.

Still, some guidelines can be established. Chief among these is to sequence series in order of research
value. Displaying a collection's strengths assists researchers in determining a collection's potential value
to their work. You will find that in a great number of collections the correspondence series contains the
most valuable research materials. In these cases, the correspondence series comes first, followed by
other series in descending order of importance. Sometimes, however, another series will take
precedence over correspondence. In the <a href="https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/catalog/04294">Walker Percy Papers (#4294)</a>, Series 1. Novels and Series 2.
Other Works come before correspondence.

UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES: In many collections, the first series is called Administrative Files or General Files.
These files pertain to the overall administration or operation of the department that created the
records; they include administrative correspondence, annual reports, budget documents, and self-
studies, among other materials. The other series are based on specific function or activities of the
department, such as Collections or Programs.

For series and subseries not determined by type of material or format, choose an order that clearly
displays the collection's contents. If there is a series that is obviously more significant within the
collection than the others, place it up front. If no single series stands out, ordering the series
alphabetically by series title is a quite satisfactory arrangement.
Collections of organizational records: the sequence of series usually follows that of the files as
maintained by the organization. Sequence may also be related to the organization's structure.
Alphabetical and/or chronological series ordering may come into play depending on the materials
present.

You can explain the overall arrangement scheme, including the sequencing of series, in the scope and
content section of the finding aid. There are many reasons for maintaining (or even creating) somewhat
odd arrangement schemes. If this happens in your collection, you owe researchers an explanation.
However, remember that the more logical your series ordering, the easier your collection will be for you
to describe and for researchers to use.

## Files

File is the next level of intellectual grouping beneath series or subseries. Files can also exist on their
own, not nested beneath series or subseries. In the example below “Letters from Jackie Dean, 1996-
2000” and “Letters from Nancy Kaiser, 1997-2001” are files in the Correspondence series.

Series 1. Correspondence

 - Letters from Jackie Dean, 1996-2000 (Folders 1-2)
 - Letters from Nancy Kaiser, 1997-2001 (Folders 3-5)

Once you have identified the intellectual order, you must decide how the files will be ordered within
each series and how the items in each folder will be arranged (if they are to be arranged at all). The
most important considerations in an arrangement scheme are the collection's original order and the
ease of intellectual access to information in the collection. If the materials are in relatively good order
when they come in, there may be no need for further arrangement below the series level. In some
cases, however, the anticipated improvement in access justifies the cost in time taken to arrange within
series.

In theory, arrangement methods can be applied at any level, though we rarely arrange at the item level.
Combinations of arrangement schemes may also be used. For example, within the same collection, a
series of subject files may be arranged alphabetically by topic while a series of correspondence may be
arranged in chronological order. As always, the overriding principle is that the arrangement must
logically fit the materials. Think about how the materials will be used and proceed from there.

**Alphabetical Order** 

Subject files are commonly arranged alphabetically by topic. A writings series may also be alphabetically
arranged by title (or it might be arranged by type of writing, then alphabetically by title).
While most correspondence is filed chronologically, letters in a literary collection may be best arranged
alphabetically by correspondent last name because literary research typically emphasizes who over
when. Most literary researchers would prefer an alphabetical listing of correspondents that they can
scan for names of interest to searching through chronological files to determine who wrote what to
whom.

**Chronological Order**

Correspondence, invoices, annual reports, reminiscences, and other types of material are often
arranged by date. Because historians are often concerned with a process of events in the life or an
individual or corporate body, most non-literary manuscript series are arranged in this way.
Files that arrive in reverse chronological order are normally left that way.
When you are imposing chronological order, order from earliest to latest date. Undated items should
follow all dated items. If an item can only be placed in a year, it should follow more completely dated
items for that year (e.g. 1946 after December 1946). The same procedure should be used for months
within years (e.g. December 1946 after 15 December 1946.

*Multiple Dates*: Items having multiple dates (usually financial or legal items) should be filed by the latest
date.

*Undated:* Help with dating undated items sometimes comes from clues found on envelopes, on
enclosures, or in the item's content (e.g., the mention of a datable historical event in a letter). Before
pursuing any but the quickest dating investigations, however, you must consider your collection's
research value and review discussions you may have had with your supervising archivist about the level
of control to be attained. Protracted research may not be warranted.

*Same date:* When arranging incoming and outgoing letters that have the same date, place the incoming
letters before the outgoing ones. If you have a large amount of correspondence with the same date and
your collection is extremely valuable, consider arranging each day`s items alphabetically by
correspondent. Enclosures should be retained with correspondence, even if the dates do not match.
Watch out, for spurious enclosures (e.g., the document is dated 15 December 1946 and the "enclosure"
is dated 6 August 1977).

*Partially dated:* A note on the filing of partially dated items: An item dated [187?] should be filed
following other items dated 1870-1879, but before all items dated 1880. Similarly, an item dated
[1871?] should be filed after all other items dated 1871, but before all items dated 1872.

*Alternate forms:* On occasion, you will find alternate forms of original items, such as transcripts or
photocopies, in your collection. The date of the alternate form is the date the alternate form was
created, not the date of the original item. You may file these alternate forms with the original, or where
the original would be filed, but the date of the alternate form should never change the earliest date of
the collection date span.

**Other Orders**

A geographical arrangement scheme may be useful for items such as travel files, data files, fund-raising
material, and some subject files. For instance, a file might be arranged by state and further subdivided
by county and city. If you have unidentified folders, make sure that the names you choose are
appropriate to the period (e.g., a complete listing by state, territories, and possessions in the 1940s
would list Hawaii as a territory).

Sometimes files or items arrive with a pre-existing numbering scheme. If this scheme is still viable, it
should be maintained, but be sure to include an explanation of the creator-generated arrangement in
the appropriate descriptive passage.

## Separated Material

In the course of arranging the materials, you may find that there are some items that, for preservation
reasons, cannot be physically stored where they intellectually belong. Size, format, and condition often
call for separate storage. Materials that are not stored in the main run of collections are called Items
Separated.

Another category of materials which may need to be stored separately is Restricted Materials. When
you prepared your processing plan, you should have consulted the accession record and the control file
to determine whether any restrictions apply to all or part of your collection. We aim at promoting free
and equal access to the collections we hold, but access by researchers to materials may be restricted for
several reasons. For example, we sometimes accept materials with strings attached. Donors may impose
restrictions due to the personal nature of the papers they give or may seek to limit use of materials,
particularly writings, they, or others represented in their papers, have produced. If only part of your
collection is restricted, those materials will need to be stored in separate folders and/or boxes so that
R&IS staff can alert patrons to the limits of the restriction or withhold the materials altogether,
depending on the nature of the restriction.

## Some Arrangement Concepts Explored

You can judge whether or not an arrangement is satisfactory by thinking ahead to the finding aid you
will write. Will arranging one way or another (or a mix of two or more different ways) allow you to
describe the collection in a meaningful way or does it risk lumping together diverse elements that will be
difficult to describe and catalog (and understand)?

Remember that you are trying to accommodate the materials that make up the collection in an
arrangement that clearly displays its components and also weaves those components together into a
cohesive whole. Your arrangement also should promote ease of access and retrieval.

**Identifying and/or constructing groupings by types or format**

Type/format arrangements dictate that materials of the same type or in like formats be grouped
together. Most often, these groups are established as series or subseries. The distinction between type
and format can be blurry because both can include multiple formats. In a type arrangement, the
content is likely to be more important than the format of the material. For example, in a
correspondence series, the content is more important than whether the correspondence is loose papers
or bound in a volume or on a floppy disc. In a format arrangement, the format is likely to be as
important as the content of the material. For example, in a pictures series, the documentation of cotton
picking in the 19th century in visual form may be as important as the information the picture conveys
about cotton picking.

 - Some examples of type arrangements are series of correspondence, writings, and financial
materials. A variety of formats may be found within each of these types.
 - Some examples of format arrangements are series of pictures, scrapbooks, and audiovisual
materials. A variety of subformats also may be found within each of these formats.

Type/format arrangements are often used when a collection of personal papers arrives in no discernible
order; in many cases, arranging according to type or format of material is perfectly adequate to meet a
collection's needs. Format arrangements are also used to highlight a format, such as pictures or
audiovisual materials, that researchers might be interested in regardless of the collection from which
they come.

**Identifying and/or constructing groupings by activity or function**

If arrangement based on type of material and/or format was always satisfactory, arranging would be
pretty dry. The naturally messy world of manuscripts, however, abhors such easy answers. The need to
consider other arrangement possibilities when planning a collection's order livens things up
considerably.

Activity/function arrangement is no respecter of type of material or format. It prefers that central ideas
rather than physical attributes provide the rallying points for grouping papers in a collection.
Type/format arrangement wants all letters together in a correspondence series. Activity/function
arrangement wants the personal correspondence of United States Representative Ike Andrews filed
separately from the correspondence he generated in his official capacity. A researcher interested in Ike's
political career may be interested in his private life, but would have an easier time using Ike's papers if
public and private aspects of his life were clearly defined by the arrangement scheme. Likewise,
researchers looking at Jackson Mathews's correspondence about St. John Perse would be unhappy
slogging through mounds of Mathews's correspondence about Paul Valéry. Those interested in Archie
Davis's notes on the Civil War will find them more useful if they are grouped with other Civil War
materials than if they are lumped together in a notes series that may also include items relating to the
Wachovia National Bank and the United States Chamber of Commerce.

A wise processor once said, "The rhyme of the papers themselves and the reasons of those
who come to use them are always the key considerations in arrangement."

**Granularity**

Granularity is a key concept in arrangement. The chief activities in arranging are grouping collection
materials into logical units and deciding how granular those units should be. For example, a unit
consisting of correspondence could be further arranged employing varying degrees of granularity. You
might arrange by era, by decade, or by year, or by individual dates. For collections with low anticipated
use, we're more likely to arrange materials in larger chunks. However, we need to be thoughtful about
how we construct our groupings because larger groupings can mean that access to the materials is more
difficult, with researchers having to wade through boxes of materials to find what they want.

**Control**

The idea of granularity relates directly to the concept of "control" in processing. The more granular our
arrangements are the more control we have over the materials in the collection.
The basic levels of control are described below. Keep in mind that you can have several different levels
of control in one collection.
It's important to understand that what we're talking about here is intellectual rather than physical
arrangement. Whatever the level of control, we always list the physical containers (boxes, folders, etc.).
See examples below.

*Collection-level control*

This is the least granular level of control. The materials are not further intellectually arranged into series
or files.

In the abbreviated finding aid example below you willl notice that the collection has no intellectual
arrangement beyond the collection level. The folder listing is a physical representation of the contents;
it does not indicate that there has been any more intellectual arrangement beyond the collection level.

Collection Number: 6000

Collection Title: Lynn Holdzkom Papers

Size: 5.0 feet of linear shelf space (approximately 300 items)

Abstract: Lynn Holdzkom (1946-2013) was a white archivist and technical services librarian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1989 to 2013. The collection contains papers of Lynn Holdzkom, including correspondence, diaries, and materials relating to her work on *Describing Archives: A Content
Standard (DACS)*.

Contents List
 - Folders 1-12: Papers

*Series-level control*

Within a collection, we may control materials at the series level. These groupings may be determined,
for example, by subject, date, creator, function, or even format. There must always be more than one
series.

The abbreviated finding aid below is an example of controlling at the series level. As with collection-level
control, the folder listing is a physical representation of the contents; it does not indicate that there has
been any more intellectual arrangement beyond the series level.

*Item-level control*

This is the most granular level of control wherein items are arranged into a logical order and described
individually. What constitutes an item varies--the item may be a scrapbook or could be a photograph on
a page in a scrapbook. We typically use item-level control for small, 19th century collections or for
collections with particular items that we want to describe individually.

## Arranging Additions

We often receive material that is related to collections that are already here. Instead of making a new
collection, we add this material to the existing collection, hence the name Addition. When faced with an
addition, the first decision that must be made is whether to incorporate the addition into the
arrangement of the original deposit or to add the additional materials at the end of the original deposit’s
arrangement in what we call a separately maintained addition.

In some cases, it may be very easy to drop materials into the appropriate places in the original deposit
without changing the arrangement or description. However, before integrating materials consider how
the collection has already been used. Some collections are heavily used by repeat researchers who may
find confusing the intermingling of new material with old. Also, for some collections, it might make
sense to highlight new material, even if it is just one letter. It is a good idea to consult with your
supervising archivist for help with the decision to interfile or to create a separate addition. If you do
interfile, be sure to put a note in the control file indicating what, where, and when new material was
interfiled.

More frequently, you will opt for creating separately maintained additions; these can come in many
styles. If the materials in the addition mimic the materials in the original deposit you can use the same
arrangement in your addition. The materials do not have to correspond exactly. For example, in your
original deposit, you might have Series 1. Correspondence, Series 2. Diaries, and Series 3. Pictures. It is
fine for your addition to have a diaries series; a pictures series; and a new series of audio-visual
materials. Of course, materials in the addition may not have anything to do with the original deposit. In
that case, it is completely fine to devise a new arrangement for them.

For documentation about additions, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Additions.md">Additions</a> page.


# Describing

The finding aid you create will lead researchers to and into collections that may be of interest to them.
Throughout processing, put yourself in the researchers’ shoes and be sure you are creating a guide that
will help them find the collections they need and the pertinent material within those collections.
Although describing is the focus of this section, arrangement underpins every description. Arranging
establishes the intellectual and physical contours of the collection. While arranging, you anticipate
describing your collection in terms of its arrangement scheme. Get the arrangement down, and
description will follow.

What is a good finding aid? In 1926, Robert B. House of the North Carolina State Historical Commission
(and later, Chancellor of the University and namesake of the Undergraduate Library) said, "Write pithily
and attractively, but with absolute truth and unchangeable regard for historical truth and accuracy."
That's a good start. Finding aids are written communications, and they should be approached with the
same care that goes into any well-written document. Attention to syntax and vocabulary are important;
consistency and correctness of punctuation count. While a finding aid can be witty, it should never be
chatty. Clarity is essential.

Lean and lucid prose is important, but so is House's "historical truth and accuracy." By becoming familiar
with the collection in its historical context, you can supply the researcher with an evaluation of the
quality of the information it contains. The researcher, however, does not care if you think the creator of
the papers was a jerk or a hero. Keep your prejudices out of the finding aid and be sure that statements
you make about the papers are true. Strive to maintain a balanced, analytical tenor.

Along with clear, concise, and carefully written prose, modern day finding aids should be characterized
by adherence to current standards for archival description. Since the days of House, there has been a
steady march toward standardization of collection descriptions in order to improve intellectual access to
archival materials. In 1994, the SHC received a grant from NEH to create MARC online catalog records so
that all of its collections would have uniform representation in the University Library’s online catalog. In
1998, the SHC began implementing Encoded Archival Description (EAD), a non-proprietary standard for
the encoding of finding aids for use in an online environment. EAD uses a tagging language that encodes
collection information in finding aids to facilitate searching within and across repositories. In 2004, the
Society of American Archivists published Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS), guidelines
which standardize the content of finding aids and MARC records. Whereas EAD and MARC address how
and where the collection information should be presented in finding aids and catalog records, DACS
speaks to what information should be present in these descriptive structures as well as in others. When
appropriate, our house protocols for description cite the corresponding DACS rules.

Go forth and describe.

## The "Typical" Finding Aid

If you knew, even without benefit of the telltale quotation marks, that the title of this section is a joke,
you have understood a basic fact about manuscript and archival materials. In the messy world of
manuscripts and archives, nothing is typical. There are, however, finding aid formats that can be
established, standards that can be set, and procedures that can be followed. The key, of course, is to
apply the formats, standards, and procedures with flexibility.

The following sections lay out the finding aid format used in the Wilson Technical Services Department
and get down to the basic procedures for describing a collection's arrangement. Because every
collection calls for a tailored arrangement scheme, every collection also calls for tailored description.
You can use some of the parts of the finding aid all of the time, and you can use all of the parts of the
finding aid some of the time, but you cannot use all of the parts of the finding aid all of the time. Review
the following sections with an eye to picking out which parts of the finding aid apply to different kinds of
collections.

DACS articulates the idea of levels in archival description. For hierarchical descriptions like finding aids,
DACS identifies three levels: multilevel minimum, multilevel optimum, and multilevel added value. *See
DACS Chapter 1.*

We almost always use multilevel added value records for our finding aids. Our finding aids will always
include:

- descriptive summary (typically includes creator, always includes collection title, size and
language of materials);
 - abstract;
 - administrative information;
 - subject headings;
 - biographical note;
 - scope and content note;
 - contents list.

Our finding aids may also include:

 - list of series;
 - series descriptions;
 - items separated;
 - related collections.

While styles have changed over the years, be assured that the goal has remained constant: the chief
function of the document you are producing is to tell researchers about your collection. With these
researchers in mind, you have arranged the collection in a clear and logical fashion; now describe it in a
similar way.

### Descriptive Summary

The descriptive summary contains basic identifying information--title, dates, creator, extent--and an
abstract of the collection. The online catalog terms will also be discussed because they are so closely
related intellectually to the abstract.

Here is an example of identifying information:

Title and dates: Richardson Preyer Papers, circa 1900-2004 (#5111)

Creator: Preyer, Richardson

Size: 96.5 feet of linear shelf space (approximately 65,600 items)

### Items Separated
The items separated section of the finding aid indicates which items have been filed separately from the
main part of the collection. An items separated list should include the various formats and number of
items/container units that have been separated. Items separated are not necessarily more important
than other items in a collection, but we alert researchers to their existence because some formats,
especially audiovisual materials, can be of research interest regardless of subject content. If there are
items separated in your collection, be sure to include this list in the finding aid for your collection.

Items separated may be listed by item number or container number (box, folder, etc.). The first example
lists individually numbered items that have been separated. Notice that we list the individually
numbered items and also indicate their physical folder. The second lists folders of unnumbered items
that have been separated.  

- Items Separated
    - Oversize Papers (OP-4240/1-12 in OPF-4240/1 of 1)
    - Extra oversize Papers (XOP-4240/1 in XOPF-4240/1 of 1)
    - Pictures (P-42420/1-624 in PF-4240/1-12)
    - Oversize Pictures (OP-P-4240/1-5 in OP-PF-4240/1 of 1)

    - Picture Albums (PA-4240/1-12)
    - Audiodisc (D-4240/1)
    - Videotapes (VT-4240/1-8)
    - Oversize Volumes (SV-4240/1-3)

    - Oversize Papers (OPF-4344/1-2)
    - Extra oversize Papers (XOPF-4344/1)
    - Pictures (PF-4344/1-16)
 
### Related Materials

The related collections section lists other collections within The Wilson Library, in other campus
departments, or in other institutions that contain materials complementing or in some way connected
to the collection in hand. This connection must be a close and substantial one for collections to be
considered related. If you stick around here long enough, you will realize that most of the people in
most of our collections are related and/or knew one another in some way. Family relationship or
acquaintance is not sufficient grounds for listing a collection as related; for that, the material in the two
collections must have some real relationship.

Names of in-house related collections usually are listed first, followed by their collection number in
parentheses.

Examples:
- H. Smith Richardson Papers (#4283).
- Southern Oral History Program Collection, Interview C-1 (#4007).
- Henry Groves Connor Papers (#175); Thaddeus Shaw Page Papers (#3848). See also official records in the North
Carolina Division of Archives and History and the National Archives.
- The manuscripts of two of the Cleavers's
books are in other repositories as follows: Ellen Grace at the
Kerlan Collection, University of Minnesota; Where the Lilies
Bloom in the Appalachian Collection, Appalachian State
University, Boone, N.C.


### Biographical/Historical Note

This section of the finding aid is headed biographical note when its focus is the life of one or more
individuals and historical note when it deals with the history of an organization or University
department. The biographical/historical note provides a rudimentary context for the descriptions that
follow. It is not a biography or a history, but a ready reference that presents an overview of the creator’s
life or history and details those aspects critical to a researcher's work with the papers. The
biographical/historical note typically is boiled down to one or two sentences to become the first part of
the abstract, which then becomes the 545 field in the MARC record.

The biographical/historical note provides context for the descriptions of collection materials and presents information critical to researchers' work with the materials. Since the note is designed to be a ready reference aid to the researcher, it should emphasize the aspects of the biography or history that relate to the collection materials. When the creator(s) are well-known, the note can be brief. It is possible to lift a biographical note from another source and credit the source.

To clarify your own understanding of the context of the collection, it may be useful to write a draft or
outline of the biographical/historical note before you begin to process the collection. Wait, however, to
complete the note until after the papers have been arranged and described. Your knowledge of the
collection may allow you to add information if your preliminary research had turned up little and will
help you focus the note to insure that it provides useful context for the materials in the collection.

### Scope and Content Note

A <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Descriptive%20Elements.md#scope-and-content-note">scope and content note</a> should identify, summarize, and contextualize the content in a collection.

### Series Descriptions

A series description is composed of three parts: the heading (title, inclusive dates, size, arrangement
scheme); the narrative description; and the folder/box/container list.

Here are some points towards writing good narrative descriptions:

- Prepare the folder/box/container list for the series before writing the description. Remember
that your description will be used by researchers in conjunction with that list. When
appropriate, refer the reader to the list for details. It is often the case that very little description
is necessary when folder titles/box lists/container lists are descriptive.

- Describe the material in a simple, straightforward way. Clarity and accuracy count. If you need
help identifying exact terms for the material you have (is it a cash book or a daybook? a
pamphlet or a leaflet?), consult the <a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/">Art and Architecture Thesaurus</a> or the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials.html">Thesaurus of Graphic Materials</a>. Keep sentences and paragraphs as short as possible; keep in mind, though, that you
may end up with some longer sentences with serial lists. Succinct descriptions facilitate use of
the materials in the collection and they are far easier to transform into scope and content notes
and ultimately into abstracts than are descriptions containing florid prose and extraneous
matter.

- Begin with a brief, but comprehensive, statement about the contents of the series. This usually
will be a statement, not a complete sentence, in the following form: Chiefly correspondence
between A and B, with a few letters each from C and D, and a small number of other letters.
Note that every item in the series is covered by this statement. Many such statements will end
with a phrase like "and a few other letters" or "and a small amount of other material." When
appropriate, follow this statement with a sentence noting principal subjects, functions, or
activities to which the material relates; relative amounts of different kinds of material;
significant gaps; and other important information about the series. It is okay if this sentence
ends up being a longish serial list.

- Organize the remainder of the description to parallel the arrangement of the series. A series
need not be broken into subseries to have several descriptive paragraphs. The description of a
series of chronologically arranged correspondence, for example, might consist of four
paragraphs successively treating letters from the periods 1800-1820, 1821-1860, 1861-1865,
and 1866-1900. A writings series might be described in a set of paragraphs, each dealing with
one type of writing--essays, book reviews, short stories, poems. When arrangement is
alphabetical (and sometimes when it is by subject), describe categories of material in order of
research value instead of in order of physical arrangement.

- Determine the appropriate degree of detail according to the research value for each part of the
contents. A single valuable letter may warrant its own description, whereas two hundred
applications might be handled by a single sentence.

- Describe the material, not the creator(s). In most cases, the biographical/historical note is the
appropriate place for background information that provides context for the documents. The
series descriptions refer to the documents themselves.

- Note the arrangement, if appropriate. If the arrangement is simple (alphabetical or
chronological, for example) say so in the series heading. If the series is small, but the
arrangement complex, there may be no need to refer to arrangement, since a quick scan of the
folder/box/container list will tell a researcher all he or she needs to know. If the series is large
and the arrangement complex, a discussion of arrangement should be included following the
description of the materials in the series.

**When There Are No Series**

Sometimes a small collections consisting chiefly (but not necessarily exclusively) of materials of one type or
format can be adequately arranged without organizing into series. Don't try to create series if they're not needed!

### Abstract

The purpose of an abstract is to suggest avenues for discovery and use of collection materials and to provide a general audience with the information they need to determine the usefulness of the collection in answering their research questions or in making the connections they are seeking. An abstract should be brief, ideally fewer than 300 words, and should focus almost entirely on the collection materials rather than the creator or collector’s biography or organizational history.

### Access Points 

Access points are controlled vocabulary terms used to facilitate machine searching in library catalogs. Wilson Library primarily uses Library of Congress Name Authority Files and Library of Congress Subject Headings. Any name or subject that will be listed as an access point MUST appear in some form in the abstract. This eliminates "blind" references (a name or subject access point exists, but the abstract does not say how it is related to the collection) that are extremely frustrating to researchers.

## Finishing the Finding Aid

Let your supervising archivist know when you have completed your finding aid in ArchivesSpace so they can review it and give feedback. When the finding aid is done to everyone's satisfaction, submit a <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Ticketing.md#blue-sheets-and-merge-requests">Blue Sheet ticket</a> so that the finding aid can be published online and statistics can be recorded. The departmental cataloger will then prepare a MARC record and load it into the online catalog. 

> Students who do not have access to the ticketing system should work with their supervising archivist to submit the ticket.


# Housing and Preservation

## Preservation and Conservation

**Preservation** consists of those actions that retard or prevent damage to materials. Among these are
controlling the macroenvironment (temperature, relative humidity, light, etc.), providing a safe
microenvironment (archivally sound housing in terms of boxes, folders, etc.), imposing preservation-
wise rules for the handling of materials by staff and researchers, devising and implementing a disaster
plan, and other measures. **Conservation**, on the other hand, is chiefly defined as bench work and is
described in terms of treatments performed on individual items. These include cleaning, deacidification,
tear repair, encapsulation, and other procedures. Whether or not you ever become involved in
conservation, preservation is undeniably an important part of your work as a processor.

Most conservators (conservationists protect wetlands and whales, not library materials) agree that the
macroenvironment is the most significant element in any preservation effort. We know, because of a
monitoring program that for years took readings throughout the building, that the renovated parts of
Wilson Library (the original 1929 building and the 1952 addition) are pretty satisfactory in terms of
temperature and relative humidity and that the 1977 addition to the library still suffers from poor
environmental controls. The macroenvironment has further been enhanced by the application of
ultraviolet-filtering film to all of our windows and light sources.

So the macroenvironment is pretty much under control for part of our holdings and pretty much out of
our control for the other part. As the 1977 addition requires work far beyond our ability to fund, we
need to focus on what we can, in fact, control: the microenvironment--the immediate environment
enclosed by the boxes and folders in which our materials are housed. This is not the place to go into the
complex relations between various elements of paper, glue, etc., many of which are still only partially
understood by chemists and other science types. Those wishing further information can start with
Ritzenthaler's Archives & Manuscripts: Conservation and work their way through the many other
publications on this topic. Suffice it to say that boxes and folders made of acidic materials tend to
transfer their acids to the materials they hold, thereby accelerating the destruction of the materials they
are supposed to protect.

Your preservation activities chiefly have to do with ensuring that materials are appropriately housed in
alkaline (non-acidic) microenvironments. You are also charged with producing clear and accurate box,
folder, and item labels that promote quick and easy retrieval and refiling and prevent unnecessary
handling of items. You may also be responsible for certain other procedures--such as preservation photocopying--and for identifying
items that are candidates for professional conservation work.

Be aware, however, that the volume of materials involved makes it possible to perform intensive
conservation treatments on only a small number of items. Especially with large 20th- and 21st-century
collections, it is entirely possible that your preservation activities will be the only such efforts made in
behalf of your collection for many, many years (if not forever). When you process, be aware that your preservation consciousness is a big factor in the survival potential of the
materials you handle.

## Conservation Workflow

All staff share in preservation responsibilities. The conservators monitor the macroenvironment, but
staff should always be on the lookout for water leaks, dramatic changes in temperature, and other signs
that may signal macroenvironmental trouble. The conservator also is responsible for evaluating
conservation requests from staff and for performing conservation treatments. Research and
Instructional Services staff observe careful handling procedures and instruct researchers on how to do
the same. Both R&IS staff and researchers occasionally find individual items that require conservation
treatments; they are also in the best position to identify collections that need rehousing. Curators alert
Conservation and Technical Services staff to collection conditions and items needing special attention during processing, including
moldy materials, born digital materials, and audiovisual materials. Tech Services has responsibility for processing all materials in a preservation-conscious
way and consulting with Conservation staff as needed.

**Outside Assistance**

The difference between preservation and conservation has already been discussed. As a processor, you
are chiefly involved in preservation. While you may occasionally do some simple work on individual
items (inner foldering, preservation photocopying), for the most part, your
duties in this area will involve selecting items as candidates for conservation treatments by others. Even
though your role in conservation is pretty peripheral, you should be aware that conservation is serious
business, and those who are good at it have learned to proceed with caution. Remember that almost all
of our items are unique and many of them are quite valuable.

As you handle materials in different collections, you will most likely encounter some items that have
been "repaired" by loving but unskilled hands. Typically, these "repairs" cause a great deal more harm
than good. Those brown stains indicate that the pieces of pressure-sensitive tape applied thirty years
ago by some well-intentioned descendent are destroying the ancestral letters they were meant to
preserve.

Conservation is not a do-it-yourself job. The Library's conservators (Preservation & Conservation Services, or P&CS), in consultation with curators and Technical Services
staff, decide what treatments specific items require. The possibilities include tear repair using
heat-set or Japanese tissue, encapsulation in archivally approved plastic, cleaning, ironing,
deacidification, adhesive removal, and other treatments, all of which require the services of a highly
trained conservation professional. This Library is fortunate to have top-rate conservation personnel and
facilities. The Department takes full advantage of these capabilities to the extent of paying the salary of
a student who is trained by the conservators to work exclusively on our materials.

**Removing Items for Conservation Treatment**

Consult the <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Preservation-and-Conservation-Services.md">Preservation and Conservation Services (P&CS) + Special Collections Technical Services Archival (TS-Archival) Workflow</a> to learn more about when and how to send materials to P&CS.

## What You Can Do

Like everything else in processing work, no hard and fast rules can be applied to determine the
preservation requirements of the collections you process. Once again, it is important to understand the
relationship among the chief processing procedures. A lighter treatment, in terms of arranging,
describing, and cataloging usually implies minimal attention to preservation. Our baseline requirements
for preservation are that, with some exceptions, all materials are housed in folders (whether new or the
ones the materials came in), the folders are numbered, and audio/visual media is separated from the
paper-based items. When particularly intensive processing is to be carried out, equally intensive
preservation and conservation measures may be indicated.

As the depth and intensity of arranging, describing, and cataloging largely depend on the collection's
perceived research value, so the extent of preservation work actually performed on a collection is
determined, to a large degree, by how valuable the material is for our researchers. Value here is chiefly
in terms of research value, although many of our items also have great artifactual value (autographs,
etc.). It would make little sense to apply extensive, time-consuming preservation or conservation
measures to materials that are of minimal research value. On the other hand, it makes a great deal of
sense to devote considerable effort to a collection containing materials of great value, whose loss would
have serious consequences for research in one or more subject areas.

Another important consideration in determining preservation work is the degree of use we expect the
materials to experience in the reading room. If we don't expect a collection to be heavily used, we may
not worry too much about the potential wear and tear. A good example involves letters in envelopes.
We typically remove letters from envelopes during processing to keep them from being damaged when
they are taken out of and placed back into envelopes. Invitations printed on sturdy paper and not
anticipated to be used heavily, however, might not be de-enveloped. Of course, if we have guessed
wrong about use, we might revisit this decision. As with processing decisions, we rely on our R&IS
colleagues to let us know when more preservation work might be needed.

Besides research value and expected use, the extent of preservation activities is also influenced by the
volume of materials in a collection. For large collections, the sheer bulk of materials involved requires
that we take a hard look at the preservation/conservation work we undertake. Archival preservation
work sometimes looks at artifactually valuable items, but most commonly proceeds on the basis of
groups of materials. This is, of course, consistent with other procedures--arranging, describing, and
cataloging--that treat materials in the aggregate. You will find that housing collections in archivally
sound boxes and folders and carefully labeling them to make retrieval easier (and thereby discouraging
unnecessary handling) are the most frequently prescribed measures for an intensive processing
project.

Sometimes we can go further than that. Particularly with smaller collections containing potentially
significant materials, you are likely to carry out more procedures like unfolding, removing fasteners, preservation photocopying, and, as
discussed above, sending items for conservation treatment.

The following preservation activities may not be indicated for every collection that you process and
often are predicated on item-level processing. Depending on factors like research value and size, you
and your supervising archivist may decide that all, some, or none of these measures are appropriate.
Your collection may not warrant these more intensive measures for reasons of physical condition, size,
or research value. Whatever the reason, do not assume that your collection is doomed to a short life. In
truth, we do not really know how much extra time we are buying for original materials above and
beyond their preordained lifespan when we take these preservation steps. Ease your mind with the
knowledge that you are serving the researchers of today and tomorrow, if not the forever future, by
speeding a collection along the path from accession to open for research. Should it later come to our
attention that the collection is handled much more than anticipated, the application of more intensive
preservation is always an option.

Before you get very far into the initial stages of processing your collection, make sure that you and your
supervising archivist are in agreement about how much preservation work the collection will receive in
addition to routine housing and labeling. It is a real waste of time to have to go back through a collection
to remove acidic materials that should have been dealt with the first time through. It is also somewhat
demoralizing to have spent your valuable time worrying over rusty fasteners in a collection that will only
see a few researchers over time.

**Unfolding**

Unfolding items is not always as easy as you might think, since materials that have been
folded for many years may be difficult to flatten without damaging them. If your processing
project calls for unfolding, follow the guidelines below.

If the paper is quite flexible, it may be possible to unfold an item and gently and briefly fold it in the
opposite direction to flatten it. No attempt should be made to eradicate fold lines; since folding
generally results in broken paper fibers, fold lines must be considered permanent markings. It is a good
idea to press very gently against fold lines with a bone folder to minimize the fold ridge. 

When paper is not flexible or is in some other way damaged, items may be difficult to unfold. These materials should be sent to Preservation & Conservation Services for further review. 

**Removing Fasteners**

Fasteners--staples, paper clips, pins, rubber bands--are the most common type of damaging materials
found in collections. Except for those made of brass, all metal fasteners rust, leaving permanent stains
on papers. Fasteners often tear manuscripts as paper is flexed against them over long periods of time.
Rubber bands dry out, disintegrate, and discolor paper. Not only do fasteners damage the paper they
bind, they can abrade and stain adjacent items.

In the best of all possible worlds, all fasteners would be removed from all collections. In reality,
however, it is rarely practical to remove them all. It is counterproductive to invest time in removing
them and reestablishing the relationship among leaves of materials. When your collection does call for
intensive processing, most of the time it is possible to remove rubber bands and to transfer materials
from binders with metal parts to folders. Often you also can remove metal paper clips (almost ALWAYS
if they are rusty). Staples are frequently left intact because of the time and effort it would take to
remove them and because the damage they might do as they are removed exceeds the damage they
may do over time.

Removal of fasteners should proceed gingerly so that no damage results.

- Safe removal of staples means lifting each folded prong with a microspatula and then using the
microspatula to lift the staple out.
- Rusted paper clips should be gently pried up from the surface of the paper with the
microspatula and then slipped off.
- Remnants of desiccated rubber bands should be lifted off the paper's surface with a
microspatula.
- Brass studs or grommets should be left intact since their removal is certain to cause more
damage than their presence.
- Note that you should not attempt to separate glued or taped items that do not come apart
easily. If separation is called for, remove these items from the collection for evaluation as
conservation candidates.

> A note about the microspatula: If you have one in your possession, guard it with your life. They have a habit of disappearing. If you borrowed one from someone else, please return it promptly.

Removal of fasteners should proceed so that the relationship between the leaves that had been
fastened together is preserved. Often the relationship between one leaf and another is clear without
fasteners or other aids. When the relation is evident from the materials themselves, you may simply let
them lie there together (e.g., page two of a letter may be obviously related to page one since the
stationery is the same for the two pages, but different from other leaves in the file; all pages of a
typescript may already be clearly marked to show that they are from the same manuscript).

When fastener removal makes relationships among previously linked leaves unclear, one of three
techniques may be employed to insure that the relationships are not lost. Consult with your supervising
archivist to determine which of these options is best for your collection:

- Materials may be annotated in the upper right hand corners to mark them as belonging
together. Annotating is the most satisfactory option for preserving the relationship of one piece
of paper to another, but it is also the most time consuming.
- Plastic-coated paper clips may be used.
- Inner folders may be created. Inner folders are made from large sheets of alkaline paper that
are folded in half. Several sizes of paper are available. If appropriate, stamp the inner folder in
red with "FRAGILE" and/or "PLEASE HANDLE CAREFULLY."

**Handling Highly Acidic Materials**

When highly acidic materials are interfiled with other items in a collection, acid can migrate from the
acidic materials to their neighbors. The transferred acid may not only stain materials over time, but also
may accelerate their embrittlement. Newspaper clippings are the most frequently encountered acidic
materials. Others include pulpy (usually brown or yellow) papers from the early 20th century and
organic materials like pressed flowers or locks of hair ("hairlooms" is the technical term).

There are several options for handling highly acidic materials; three of the most common are listed
below. Note that organic materials should always be removed, but if these materials have informational
value, you may use option three below.

- Remove all highly acidic materials and place them in their own series or subseries. This works
when the highly acidic materials can logically be grouped in a format-based series or subseries
(e.g., a clippings series) or in a separate folder or folders within a series or subseries (e.g., a
folder in a writings series). When highly acidic materials are closely related to other items,
however, that relationship should be maintained (e.g., a clipping enclosed and referred to in a
letter).
- Enclose highly acidic materials in inner folders made of alkaline paper and interfile the foldered
materials in the regular order. Inner folders are made from large sheets of alkaline paper that
are folded in half. Several sizes of paper are available. Inner folders are annotated with their
contents on the front top right-hand corner (in a chronological run, just the date will suffice)
and, if appropriate, stamped in red with "FRAGILE" and/or "PLEASE HANDLE CAREFULLY." If the
acidic materials are newspaper clippings, you may group them together in one inner folder filed
at the back of the folder. It is not necessary to annotate the inner folder with the contents.
- Preservation photocopy highly acidic materials, interfile the photocopies, and remove the
originals or place them in inner folders. Photocopying a document onto alkaline paper is also an
excellent way to preserve its contents and to shield the original from future handling.
Preservation photocopying requires skills that most processors already possess--handling
documents with great care and operating photocopiers. Preservation photocopying proceeds
like any other photocopying except that you must use only alkaline paper (available in Tech
Services). After photocopying, newspaper clippings are often put in the discard or return pile.
Documents other than clippings, however, are often retained. In this case, place the original in
an inner folder annotated to reflect its contents and stamped in red with "VERY FRAGILE."

Highly acidic materials may be handled in various ways within the same collection. You may remove the
bulk of the clippings to a clippings series, subseries, or folders within a series or subseries, and
photocopy or inner-folder those clippings that need to remain with particular letters. It is important to
think about if this work is necessary and perform it strategically. You might opt to do nothing at all
because it would be too time consuming to separate highly acidic materials and/or an overkill of effort
given the research and artifactual value of the collection.

**Housing and Labeling**

Conservation professionals have come to consider rehousing in alkaline folders and boxes the most
significant collection-level step that an archival repository can take to retard paper deterioration. Highly
acidic containers actually accelerate the decay of their contents by transferring acid to the papers they
touch and by emitting peroxides and other harmful by-products into the microenvironment enclosed by
the boxes. When you take materials out of acidic liquor cartons, manila folders, kraft-paper envelopes,
and place them in alkaline housing, you are taking an important step in preserving them. Likewise, when
you take the additional step of segregating oversize items and special-format materials (pictures,
audiotapes, etc.) and housing them with other such materials, you are not only protecting the special-
format materials, but avoiding the damage they can cause to other materials when they are interfiled
with a relatively uniform run of foldered papers. When you clearly label the contents of a collection, you
decrease the need to rifle through other materials in search of the desired items, thus reducing the wear
and tear materials must endure.

Researchers of the future will bless the unknown hands that made possible the survival of the raw
materials of history. Those hands are yours.

**Boxes**

Several styles of boxes are used in Tech Services. Historically, SHC and SFC collections have typically, though not
always, been housed in gray document cases ("Hollingers") while University Archives materials have been housed in
cardboard record center cartons ("Paige boxes"). In recent years, we have tended to house more modern SHC and SFC collections in Paige boxes instead of Hollingers. These are special boxes that have been engineered to house archival materials. Note that these boxes do not come cheap; we do not retire them to the recycle dumpster until they are totally worn out.

You should consult with your supervising archivist about what type of box is right for your collection. In
any case, be sure to neither overfill nor underfill boxes. Overfilling means that materials will become
distorted over time and/or risk being damaged when they are removed and refiled. Underfilling means
that folders will lean at an unhealthy angle that causes them and their contents to curl at the top or
bottom. Cardboard spacers should be used to fill unused space to prevent this from happening.

**Folders**

Folders offer support and protection to the materials they house. Clear and accurate folder labels
promote quick and easy retrieval and refiling, which prevents unnecessary handling of items. Letter-size
folders hold items up to 8-1/2 by 11 inches or so; legal-size folders hold items up to 8-1/2 by 14 inches
or so. Larger items, except those that can be SAFELY folded ONCE to fit in letter-size or legal-size folders,
call for oversize housing.

We almost always use legal-size folders for materials in the Southern Historical Collection and the
Southern Folklife Collection. We typically use letter-size folders for materials in University Archives. To
prevent dangerous shifting of materials, folders must snugly fit their box both in length and in width.
Follower blocks take care of the slack when there are not enough folders to fill a box. Document cases
require legal-size folders to fill the length requirement. You may use either legal- or letter-size folders in
record center boxes, depending on which size better accommodates the materials you are housing.
When only a few legal-size items are present in a collection destined for a records center box, these
items may be stored folded so that the contents of the box can be housed in letter-size folders. What
you cannot do is mix legal- and letter-size folders in the same box. If you do that, the letter-size folders
will slide around in an unhealthy fashion.

The amount of material that can safely be placed in a folder depends upon the condition of the material
and its value. When items are brittle, only a few should be placed in a folder to avoid excessive abrasion
and each item may need its own inner folder. The occasional fragile, acidic, or slightly-torn item in an
otherwise stable folder should be protected by enclosing it in an inner folder.

Except for folders containing only one or two leaves, all folders should be "squared." Use the pre-scored
lines to "square" the edge of a folder to allow papers to stand vertically along the bottom. Place as many
items as can fit easily into a folder with the bottom squared.

Each document should be able to stand up straight along the bottom of the folder without curling on the
edge. Sturdier or thicker items (multipage reports, for example) may fill a folder more fully. Volumes
that can comfortably fit in folders should be placed, spine down, in folders and added in the correct
order within the collection’s folder numbering system. Length and width are primary considerations, but
thickness also counts. You may decide that a volume of greater thickness than that provided by the pre-
scored lines on folder bottoms is too large for normal foldering, although wide volumes can sometimes
be comfortably accommodated by creating your own folds along the folder bottom. More than one
volume occasionally may be housed in one folder, depending, of course, on the dimensions of the
volumes involved.

Volumes housed in bulky looseleaf binders may be removed from the binders and placed in a folder or
folders if doing so does not affect the artifactual value of the item. In some cases, information of value
appearing on the binder may be photocopied onto acid-free paper and preserved with the inner pages.
Any volume that cannot be foldered, whether too large in height, width, or depth, is treated as a
"separated" volume. 

How much information appears on the folder label depends on the particular situation. Consult with
your supervising archivist if you have difficulty determining how specific your folder labels need to be.
When foldering chronologized items, try to make reasonable folder breaks. Group by months, half-
months, three-month spans, six-month spans, years, but avoid strange breaks like "3 January-13
February 1903." The same rule holds for alphabetized runs, where single letters or letter spans are fine,
but "A-Cun" then "Cuo-Di" should be avoided. Note that a folder holding all material for the period April-
July 1946 should be labeled "April-July 1946" even if there is no material for some days (even days in
early April or late July). If one folder holds materials dated January-June 1888 and the next item is dated
October 1888, start the next folder with October, not July. You may want to note in the description that
there are no items for July-September 1888.

If the collection's original folders are in good condition and
labeled clearly, we may opt not to re-folder. We always re-
folder collections that arrive in hanging folders because hanging
folders do not fit comfortably in our boxes. Consult with your
supervising archivist to determine if your collection can be left in
its original folders.

Whether or not the collection is re-foldered, you will number the folders in the collection. Begin at
Series 1 with Folder 1 and continue in one run of numbers through all of the series until you reach the
end. We do not always list folder numbers in the finding aid, but we do always number the folders
themselves.

Restricted materials should be isolated in their own folders and labeled "RESTRICTED." Restricted folders
do not necessarily need to be isolated in their own boxes if the restriction does not prohibit all access by
researchers.

**Boxes and Folders for Additions**

Both folders and boxes should be labeled sequentially after the original collection or most recent
addition. So, if the last box in the series was 29, the first box of the addition will be 30. Same goes for
folders. If possible, folders and boxes that comprise an addition should include the addition name on the
label.

**Items Separated**

Most of the materials in our collections are housed in standard archival folders and boxes. Some items,
however, because of their size or other physical characteristics, cannot be housed in such containers.
When items are separated from their collections for storage elsewhere, they are known as "items
separated." Separating these items not only protects them, it also protects other materials in their
collections from the damage these items might otherwise cause.

In the <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/How-to-Proceed.md#separated-material">Arranging section</a>, we discussed when and why to separate pictures. To recap, preservation points
to isolating pictures. Isolated, they are subject to far less handling than they would receive were they
interfiled with other materials. This is particularly important in the case of fragile pictures. The main of
the collection can also benefit from the removal of pictures, especially when the pictures are
photographic images. All forms of photography involve chemical processes that may continue, albeit at
very slow rates, long after the image is set. Contact with these chemicals can seriously damage
surrounding materials. Additionally, when the day comes that we have cold storage for photographs,
separated photographs will be easier to identify and move to a better storage climate.

Papers or photographs that do not fit into legal folders without folding are typically separated from their
collections. Medium large materials are housed 16" x 20" or 2' x 3' folders in flat, grey boxes and very
large sheets are housed in map and print folders in map cases. Note that folding large items is often
permissible if the item is of low artifactual value. The decision to fold, however, should be made in
consultation with your supervising archivist. **Cutting large items down to size is not acceptable.**

> Volumes that fit in legal folders are typically housed in document cases or records cartons. If they do not fit, they are separated from the collection.

Finally, audiovisual materials, are separated from the collection.

Note that separating items physically has little impact on how you arrange or describe them. These
items should be listed and discussed where they belong INTELLECTUALLY in your collection.

# Finishing the Job 

You have arranged, described, and preserved. Now it is time to pass the materials off to the stacks manager and clear
off your work area in preparation for your next job. It is **unacceptable** to call a processing job finished
when you still have collection parts or collection detritus on, under, or around your desk or anywhere
else in Tech Services.

## Shelving

Place your newly processed materials on the shelves next to the TS-Biblio vault and submit a Physical Processing Planner ticket to the stacks manager (Margaret). Consult with your supervising archivist if you do not have access to this planner. The stacks manager will barcode the materials, shelve them, and enter their locations into ArchivesSpace.

## Discards

Some materials cannot be retained with collections; other materials should not be kept. At this point in
your processing project, you and your supervising archivist would likely have determined if you have
materials not appropriate for retention. TS-Archival consults with curatorial units to determine how to handle discards. Do not discard any collection materials without first consulting with the appropriate curator.

Donors are asked to specify in the deed of gift what they want done with materials not appropriate for
retention with the collections they give. The choices are typically to return these items to the donor or
for the donor to give us permission to do with them what we wish. The gift agreement should state the
donor’s preference for disposition of discards, but if there is any uncertainty please check with your
supervising archivist.

When a collection is a gift and the donor DOES want materials back, the curator will negotiate the return of items not included with the collection to the
donor. It is our responsibility to clearly indicate why the items are being left out of the collection, i.e.
duplicates, student grades are present, publications unrelated to the collection, etc.

University Archives materials deemed not appropriate for retention are never returned to the donating department. They
are recycled, confidentially recycled, or transferred to another library department. Your supervising
archivist will help you dispose of these items.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES LEAVE UNLABELED BOXES OF DISCARDS ANYWHERE IN THE WILSON LIBRARY TO BE DEALT WITH AT A LATER DATE.

## Other Detritus

You can accumulate a lot of trash during processing, including old folders and containers. Please dicard your trash in one of the following ways:

 - Keep in TS-Archival for reuse.
     - Archival boxes and folders that could reasonably be reused for other collections. 
 - Take it to the surplus room.
     - Binders, hanging folders, and other materials not needed in TS-Archival but that could reasonably be used by someone else.   
 - Recycle it.
     - Cardboard goes in the cardboard recycling dumpster in the loading dock area (outside the building).
     - Other paper goes in the blue recycling bins in the loading dock area (inside the building).
         - Do not overfill the blue recycling bins. If the bin is already 1/2 - 3/4 full, use a different bin.    
 - Throw it away.
     - Rusty paper clips, rubber bands, and anything else that can't be reused or recycled.  

Once you've removed all of your trash, please wipe down your work area so it will be clean for the next person/processing project. 

# Additions

We often receive material that is related to collections that are already here. Instead of making a new collection, we add this material to the existing collection. Additions are maintained separately in a physical sense, but we try to integrate them intellectually with materials received previously to facilitate discovery. Sometimes this is easily done; sometimes it is better to append new description to the end of the finding aid.

For documentation about additions, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Additions.md">Additions</a> page.

# History of *How to Proceed* 

The first edition of _How to Proceed: A Procedures Manual for the Southern Historical Collection and General and Literary Manuscripts_ was wriiten by Tim West and Lynn Holdzkom in 1989. It was revised by Lynn Holdzkom in May 1990 and December 1994, by Lynn Holdzkom and Linda Sellars in August 2000, and by Nancy Kaiser and Technical Services Friends in October 2006. This version of _How to Proceed_, created in GitHub by Dawne Lucas in 2025, is based on a revision captured by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180105011034/https:/library.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/UNC-CH-Library-Archival-Processing-Manual.pdf">Internet Archive</a> in January 2018, and has been modified to document current procedures.
