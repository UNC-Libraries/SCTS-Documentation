# Saying it

**Good writing and editing:** Deathless prose is not required; good concise standard English is required. Be prepared to have your finding aid edited by those who have been writing these things for a long time. Sometimes editing corrects errors; sometimes it clarifies description. Often editing serves to add words or phrases that appear in finding aids describing materials similar to those in your collection. Editors add these words or phrases to facilitate searching across finding aids.

**Timeliness of description:** It’s tempting to say things like “Fluffy now lives in Cary, N.C., where she teaches obedience classes.” Although additions or other circumstances will cause some finding aids to be revised in future, many finding aids will represent their collections for years and years. If your description includes statements that talk about what someone’s doing now or where that someone currently lives or how many books she’s written, you risk your description becoming quickly outdated. You can get around this by making the description more oblique and therefore more able to endure the test of time. Some examples are: 

- :smiley: In 2001, Fluffy moved to Cary, N.C., where she taught obedience classes.

- :smiley: As of 1969, she had written 18 novels about cane toads in Australia.

- :smiley: The Hamptons had 24 children, 16 dogs, and 44 goldfish in 2001.

**Lest ye be judged:** You may think that the person you’re working on was the cat’s meow. Please remember, however, that you’re writing description, not evaluation or appreciation (that’s for the other side of the desk). Keep the judgment out of your words and your tone. Just the facts, please.

**Consistency:** Please try to be consistent in what you call people, places, things. If she's Mary Virginia del Rio, please don't call her Mary Va. del Rio. Ever. Think searchability.

**Verb tenses:** Use the present tense when referring to the papers themselves. Use the past tense when referring to actions of the creators or recipients of the papers.

- :smiley: _There are three letters from John to Mary._

- :smiley: _In a letter of 3 June 1870, Amos described his trip to High Point, N.C._

**Say it and say it again:** We don't expect people to read our finding aids from beginning to end. This is especially true of online finding aids, which are designed to help researchers navigate directly to descriptions of the materials of interest. Therefore, repeat important information (e.g., complete names, full titles of writings, when an event took place) in every intellectual component throughout the finding aid.

**Use abbreviations sparingly:** There are only a few cases in which the abbreviation is so well-known that it makes sense to use it.

**BUT verbosity is discouraged:** You’re writing description, not deathless prose. Keep it simple both in sentence structure and vocabulary choice. Again, remember that researchers don't typically read through the whole finding aid beginning to end, but seek out the parts that hold particular interest for them.

# Capitalization

## When to capitalize folder titles

Especially when writing folder titles for University Archives, it is important to be consistent with capitalization throughout our 
collections. You can become an expert by following a few simple rules.  
 
There are three main categories that require capitalization: 

**1. Official names of events**

If the event's official name is "Great Alaska Shootout," and the event happens to be a basketball tournament, "basketball tournament" should be lowercase. But if the event's official name is "Midnight Sun Basketball Championships," all words should be capitalized:
 
- Carolina Invitational baseball tournament 
- Concert for Carolina benefit event 
- Atlantic Coast Conference Championships 


**2. Names of buildings**

- Ehringhaus Dining Hall
- Morehead Planetarium
- Stone Center
- South Building
- Spencer Residence Hall

**3. Corporate bodies (this includes committees, boards, and groups)**

- Faculty Information Technology Advisory Committee
- Chancellor's Committee on Diversity
- Student Affairs Advisory Board
- Black Student Movement
- Board of Trustees
- Carolina American Indian Caucus
- Office of Research Development
- Carolina Latinx Center
- Atlantic Coast Conference
- Harmonyx A Cappella

**4. Other examples**

- African American (not hyphenated)

- a.m.

- American Indian (not hyphenated)

- antebellum

- Appalachia

- army

  - Although Worth was convicted, Gorrell obtained for Worth a reasonable bail that allowed the abolitionist to escape to the North.

- northern

- northerner

- p.m.

- president (capitalize when it precedes a personal name)

  - At the 1960 Democratic national Convention, Terry Sanford seconded John F. Kennedy's nomination for president of the United States.
  
  - In this letter, President Richard M. Nixon rejected the committee's request that he turn over the tapes of "private conversations
    with a number of my closest aides."

- Senate

- senator (capitalize when it precedes a personal name)

- South (as a region of the United States)

  - The letters describe Delia's travels from the South to New York in 1852.
  
- southern

  - He wrote in great detail about the daily plantation life at Woodstock, including crops, how the slaves lived, relationships between slaves and masters, jobs and positions on the plantation, how the southern elite socialized, and what he called southern hospitality.

# Abstracts, Collection Overview, Biog/Hist notes

## Abstracts and Collection Overviews for Multi-Series Collections

**A good way to write the abstract and collection overview:** This is not the only way to write a good collection overview and abstract, but it usually works pretty well. You may want to ask for guidance on how to do this the first time you give it a try. And see below for what to do when there's only one series.

- Copy all your series descriptions into the collection overview area of the finding aid

- Edit the descriptions, retaining only the truly significant content (always a judgment call), to create the a collection overview.
You may content tag the collection overview or leave it for the cataloger

- Copy the collection overview into the abstract area ```(<abstract encodinganalog="520">)```. Omit all internal tagging except ```<title>``` and ```<emph>```

- Edit the abstract so that it's as concise as possible

- You may include brief biographical/historical information to provide context for the collection but it is no longer required  
(we no longer have this tag in the finding aid: ```<abstract encodinganalog="545">```)

- Review the abstract to make sure that the necessary access points (online catalog headings) can be grounded in it 

## Abstracts and Collection Overviews for One-Series Collections

If you use the method above to write abstracts and collection overviews when there's just one series, you wind up with pretty much
the same description three times in the finding aid (once in the series description, once in the collection overview, and once in 
the ```<abstract encodinganalog="520">```. This is overkill. If you have only one series, write its description as the collection overview. Use the collection overview as the ```<abstract encodinganalog="520">``` (with editing as needed). At the series level, you may either omit the ```<scopecontent>``` note entirely or use it for information that's not appropriate for the collection overview or abstract.  

## ```<Bioghist>``` versus ```<Scopecontent>```

```<bioghist>``` is about the creator(s) of the materials. ```<scopecontent>``` is about the materials in the collection. It’s sometimes difficult to separate what goes in one from what goes in the other. Try for as little overlap as possible. For example, if you’re working on the papers of a creator who was involved in a particular project and the resulting materials are what’s in the collection, talk about the creator’s background in ```<bioghist>```. You can also mention that the creator undertook the project at hand. But save the details of the project for ```<scopecontent>```. 

Here’s a short example:

- :smiley: ```<bioghist><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Alma Ravenal was born in rural Georgia in 1831. Until the age of 25, she worked part-time as a missionary in China. After her return to the United States, she became a trapeze artist, traveling with various small circuses. During this period, she was involved in a project to memorialize great trapeze artists who were also missionaries. Ravenal died in 1876 as a result of a fall during a performance in DosiWallops, Wash.</p></bioghist>```

- :smiley: ```<scopecontent><head>Collection Overview</head><p>The collection includes materials, 1870-1876, relating to missionary and trapeze artist Alma Ravenal’s efforts to document the history of trapeze artists who were also missionaries. Correspondence, 1870-1876, is chiefly between Ravenal and friends and family members trying to convince her to give up her pursuit. Financial records document expenditures for bail and other expenses Ravenal incurred as she became increasingly vehement in her pursuit. Photographs are largely etc., etc.</p></scopecontent>```

## Biographical Note verses Historical Note

Biographical notes are about individuals and families; historical notes are about organizations.


# Folder Titles

**Folder titles:** Folder titles come in many shapes and sizes. In general: Do not end folder titles with a period.

- :smiley: _Steele, Danielle_

Use colons to show subordination. Capitalize first word after colon.

- :smiley: _Missionary Society: Committee on Part-time Missionaries_

- :smiley: _1901: January-March_

- :smiley: _1901: Undated_

Always use commas before dates:

- :smiley: _Missionary Society: Minutes, 1901-1903_

- :smiley: _Correspondence, 1901-1902_

- :smiley: _Speeches, 1901-1902_

Use commas before locations:

- :smiley: _Missionary Society: Annual meeting, Raleigh, 1902_

Use colons in complex statements:

- :smiley: ```<title render="doublequote">How the West Was Won</title>:``` _Missionary Society, Raleigh, 1966_

You may want to use the subordination model cited above when you want to list genre and dates for some folders and genre with 
modifying information for other folders. For example, a series may contain correspondence, 1901-1956; speeches for which you have both
titles and dates; and miscellaneous other items. Remembering that you use a simple comma before locations and before dates, the folder 
list would look like this:  

- :smiley: _Correspondence, 1901-1902_

- :smiley: _Correspondence, 1903-1956_

- :smiley: _Speech: ```<title render="doublequote">How I Spent My Summer Vacation</title>,``` _Raleigh, 1922_

- :smiley: _Speech: ```<title render="doublequote">How the West Was Won</ title>:``` _Civitan Club, Chapel Hill, 1960_

- :smiley: _Miscellaneous_

Use the Last name, First name format:

- :smiley: _Clark, Septima Poinsette_

**Capitalization of folder titles:** Unless they are proper nouns or formal titles, only capitalize the first word of a folder title. 

- :smiley: _Folder 21 Annual reports_

- :rage: _Folder 21 Annual Reports_

**Creator-generated folder titles:** We usually use creator-generated folder titles. Add this statement (or something close) just before 
the folder list begins when you are using folder titles as received:

- :smiley: _Note that original file folder titles have, for the most part, been retained._

HOWEVER, take that statement with a grain of salt: Make the list as intelligible as you can without fretting over the contents of each folder. You may have to spell out abbreviations or take a quick look to see what some weird combination of letters and numbers means.

The creator may have been creative with names, punctuation, date style, etc., but you must strive for consistency. Making the creator's folder titles conform to our style is usually just a question of re-ordering the words. Do not hesitate to do this. It's okay to list names in first name, last name order or last name, first name order, but you should pick one and do it consistently throughout the listing.

**Folder list order:** Folder order should have some kind of logic. Alphabetical or chronological order should be easily discerned. Any other order should make sense in terms of the papers. You are under no obligation to include an ```<arrangement>``` statement for each series or subseries. If there is no discernible order (especially in short folder lists), leave the ```<arrangement>``` statement out.  

Alphabetical by name means Last name, First name.

- :smiley: _Bushyhead, Robert H._

Company names that include a person’s name are alphabetized by the first letter of the first word in the name.  

- :smiley: _J. M. Dent and Sons_


# Transcribing Titles and Captions

If an unpublished item, such as a photograph or home movie, has a title or caption written on it, we will likely want to replicate that title in the finding aid. We will want to distinguish between titles and captions that come with items (creator-generated information) from the titles and explanations that we provide (archivist-generated information). To do this, we use quotations marks.  

Examples:

**Creator-generated title**

For example, a photograph with "Cullom Hall, 1926" written on the back:  

```<unittitle><title render="doublequote">Cullom Hall, 1926</title></unittitle>```  

**Archivist-generated title**

For example, a photograph that we identify as being Cullom Hall in 1926:  

```<unittitle>Cullom Hall, 1926</unittitle>```  

**Creator-generated title with archivist-generated clarification**

For example, a photograph with "Dean Hall" written on the back but we know that building has been re-named Holdzkom Hall:  

```<unittitle><title render="doublequote">Dean Hall</title> (now Holdzkom Hall)</unittitle>```  

**Creator-generated caption**

For example, a photograph that we identify as being Cullom Hall in 1926 that has "Be sure to notice the elephant in the background"
written on the back:  

```<unittitle>Cullom Hall, 1926</unittitle></did><scopecontent><p>Caption reads: <emph render="doublequote">Be sure to notice the elephant in the background.</emph></p></scopecontent>```  

**Archivist-generated caption**

For example, a photograph that we identify as being Cullom Hall in 1926, includes a person we identify as Edward Cullom standing on 
front steps (not noted in original descriptions provided by creator):  

```<unittitle>Cullom Hall, 1926</unittitle></did> <scopecontent><p>Image includes Edward Cullom.</p></scopecontent>``` 


# Commas, Other Punctuation, Capitalization

**Introductory phrases and clauses:** Use a comma to set off all introductory phrases and clauses.

- :smiley: _In December 1980, she totally freaked out._

- :smiley: _By the following summer, she was the CEO for a leading corporation._

**Terms in series:** In a series of three or more terms, use a comma after each term.

- :smiley: _She traveled to Raleigh, Atlanta, and Memphis._

**Names as modifiers:** With appositives involving names, add a comma when the full name is used. Leave the comma out when only part
of a name is used.

- :smiley: _His wife, Mary Johnson Smith, ran away in 1806._

- :smiley: _His daughter Sue was a famous stripper._

**Other modifiers:** Use commas before and after location names used as modifiers but not before and after Jr./Sr.

- :smiley: _Goodman moved to Brooklyn, N.Y., in August 1900._

- :smiley: _Ken Griffey Jr. never attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill._

**Quotation marks:** Commas and periods go inside quotes, while colons and semi-colons go outside quotes. Check this carefully when
doing EAD markup.

- :smiley: _She called herself_ ```<emph render="doublequote">Lil,</emph>``` _but everyone knew her as Nancy._

- :smiley: _Included is the 1922 version of his unsold novel,_ ```<title render="doublequote">When Bad Things Happen to Bad People</title>;``` _his unsold short story,_ ```<title render="doublequote">Worser and Worser</title>;``` _and his unsold anthology,_ ```<title render="doublequote">Major Works.</title>```  

**Capitalization of series and subseries titles:** Do capitalize all of the words in the supplied title at the series and subseries level.

- :smiley: _Series 1. Correspondence and Related Material_

- :smiley: _Series 2.1. Other Writings_

**Capitalization of job titles:** Don't capitalize job titles unless they are used as an identifier before a name.

- :smiley: _She was director of the Sports Information office._

- :smiley: _Robert Wagner, mayor of New York City, was there._

- :smiley: _Mayor Robert Wagner of New York City was there._

**Capitalizing official names of events:** If the event's official name is "Great Alaska Shootout," and the event happens to be a 
basketball tournament, "basketball tournament" should be lowercase. But if the event's official name is "Midnight Sun Basketball 
Championships," all words should be capitalized.

- :smiley: _Carolina Invitational baseball tournament_

- :smiley: _Concert for Carolina benefit event_

- :smiley: _Atlantic Coast Conference Championships_

**Capitalize names of buildings:**

- :smiley: _Ehringhaus Dining Hall_

- :smiley: _Stone Center_

- :smiley: _Morehead Planetarium_

- :smiley: _South Building_

- :smiley: _Spencer Residence Hall_

**Capitalize corporate bodies:**

- :smiley: _Faculty Information Technology Advisory Committee_

- :smiley: _Chancellor's Committee on Diversity_

- :smiley: _Carolina American Indian Caucuse_

- :smiley: _Student Affairs Advisory Board_

- :smiley: _Black Student Movement_

- :smiley: _Board of Trustees_

- :smiley: _Office of Research Development_

- :smiley: _Carolina Latinx Center_

- :smiley: _Atlantic Coast Conference_

# PersNames, CorpNames, GeogNames, Titles, Dates, Numbers 

## PersnNames and CorpNames

**Consistency:** Try to be consistent in how you write names. It is often best to use the fullest version of the name first in each
section of your EAD finding aid (e.g., abstracts, biographical/historical note, collection overview, c01 series descriptions). In 
subsequent references within each section, you may use either the last name alone (unless this makes for unclear references) or the 
most-used combination of given and surname. If the appropriate name is _Hetty Betty Bodine_, you may refer to her as _Bodine_ or 
_Hetty Betty Bodin_e or perhaps _Hetty Bodine_ or _Hetty_. Do not, however, arbitrarily start calling her _Hetty B. Bodine_ or _H. Betty Bodine_ or _Betty_ (unless she went by _Betty_, in which case, use that name consistently).

When an individual uses initials in a personal name, place a period followed by a space after each letter. 

- J. G. de Roulhac Hamilton

**Abbreviations:** Usually spell out names of corporate bodies. There can be exceptions, but this will be determined on a case-by-case
basis, often according to whether or not there is an authority record for a name. For example, use and instead of & unless you know that
the authority record specifies & (remember to use & for & in EAD-encoded finding aids).  

- :smiley: _University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill_

- :smiley: _Smith and Company_

## United States or U.S.

Do not abbreviate for major government bodies and officials.

- United States Congress

- United States Senate

- United States Senator

- United States Representative

- United States Supreme Court

Abbreviate for lesser government bodies and for military units

- U.S. War Labor Board

- U.S. Farm Security Administration

- U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

## GeogNames

Abbreviate a state name when it directly follows the name of a city or a county (parish). Otherwise spell out the name of the state.

**Abbreviations:** Always use the approved Library of Congress state abbreviations when the state is a modifier. Note that these are
NOT the 2-letter standard United States Post Office abbreviations. Note also that there is no space between N. and C. (N.C.) or S. and C. (S.C.) or W. and Va. (W.Va.).

- :smiley: _Chapel Hill, N.C._

- :smiley: _Little Rock, Ark._

**State abbreviations:** Alabama: Ala., Alaska: Alaska, Arizona: Ariz., Arkansas: Ark., California: Calif., Colorado: Colo., Connecticut: Conn., Delaware: Del., District of Columbia: D.C., Florida: Fla., Georgia: Ga., Hawaii: Hawaii, Idaho: Idaho, Illinois: Ill., Indiana: Ind., Iowa: Iowa, Kansas: Kans., Kentucky: Ky., Louisiana: La., Maine: Me., Maryland: Md., Massachusetts: Mass., Michigan: Mich., Minnesota: Minn., Mississippi: Miss., Missouri: Mo., Montana: Mont., Nebraska: Neb., Nevada: Nev., New Hampshire: N.H., New Jersey: N.J., New Mexico: N.M, New York: N.Y., North Carolina: N.C., North Dakota: N.D., Ohio: Ohio, Oklahoma: Okla., Oregon: Or., Pennsylvania: Pa., Puerto Rico: P.R., Rhode Island: R.I., South Carolina: S.C., South Dakota: S.D., Tennessee: Tenn., Texas: Tex., Utah: Utah, Vermont: Vt., Virginia: Va., Virgin Islands: V.I., Washington: Wash., West Virginia: W.Va., Wisconsin: Wis., Wyoming: Wyo.

**Places as part of name:** Always spell out state names when they are part of a name. This also goes for the United States.

- :smiley: _North Carolina Center for Public Policy Research_

- :smiley: _West Virginia Prison for Women_

- :smiley: _United States Senate_

**Stand-alones:** Always spell out state names when they stand alone. This also goes for the United States.

- :smiley: _She is a native of North Carolina._

- :smiley: _They came to the United States in 1856._

## Titles (published works)

Use ```<title>``` tags to add italics or quotation marks to formal titles; use ```<emph>``` tags to add bold, italic, or quotation marks in all other cases.

**Italics:** Use italics for published books, pamphlets; proceedings, collections of materials (e.g., short story collections, poetry collections), long poems, periodicals, and newspapers (including newspaper sections published separately). Also use italics for motion pictures; major musical works (e.g., operas, symphonies), paintings, drawings, statues, and other works of art. Make sure the ```</title>``` tag comes before any ending punctuation. 

- :smiley: _In his_ ```<title render="italic">Dictionary of North Carolina Biography</title>,``` _Powell ..._

- :smiley: _Her column appeared in the_ ```<title render="italic">Charlotte News</title>,``` _1942-1953._

- :smiley: _He wrote for the_ ```<title render="italic">New York Times Book Review</title>``` _regularly between 1966 and 1970._

- :smiley: _His poetry collection,_ ```<title render="italic">Call of the Wildest</title>``` _(Oxford, 1951), won the North Carolina Weird Poetry Society award in 1952._

- :smiley: _He wrote extensively about seeing a production of_ ```<title render="italic">The Emperor Jones</title>``` _in 1939._

**Quotation marks:** Use quotation marks for theses, dissertations, short stories, short poems, chapters, journal and newspaper articles, columns, and all unpublished works regardless of length. Make sure the ```</title>``` tag comes before or after punctuation as appropriate.

- :smiley: _His novel,_ ```<title render="doublequote">Wilder West,</title>``` _was never published._

- :smiley: _Her column,_ ```<title render="doublequote">Little Moi,</title>``` _appeared in the_ ```<title render="italic">Chapel Hill Messenger</title>,``` _1909-1910._

- :smiley: _His poem,_ ```<title render="doublequote">Now There Are None</title>``` _won the Minor Poets of Portland award in 1902._

## ```<Title>``` versus ```<Emph>```

```<title>``` and ```<emph>``` result in the same outputs to the screen, but they're not the same intellectually. ```<title>``` is for titles, italic or quoted; ```<emph>``` supplies italic or quotation marks in all other cases. Most of the time, you'll have a title. Examples of correct ```<emph>``` usage include:  

- :smiley: _The letter indicates that she was_ ```<emph render="doublequote">goosed</emph>``` _by the soldier._

- :smiley: _In the letter from Gettysburg, Penn., dated 3 July 1863, he wrote,_ ```<emph render="doublequote">What the <emph render="italic">HELL</emph> am I doing here?</emph>```

- :smiley: _Her name was McGill, and she called herself_ ```<emph render="doublequote">Lil,</emph>``` _but everyone knew her as_ ```<emph render="doublequote">Nancy.</emph>```  

## Dates

**General:** Dates style is as follows. No commas, please.

- :smiley: _23 April 1876_

- :smiley: _April 1876_

**Centuries:** Use Arabic numerals for centuries. Include a hyphen if the century is used as an adjective.

- :smiley: _19th century_

- :smiley: _20th century_

- :smiley: _10th century_

- :smiley: _18th-century politics_

Numberical representations of centuries DO NOT have an apostrophe.

- :smiley: 1800s NOT 1800's

**Date spans:** Never use a from without a to.

- :rage: _She was fire chief from 1906-1920._

- :smiley: _She was fire chief from 1906 to 1920._

- :smiley: _She was fire chief, 1906-1920._

**Life dates:** You should provide life dates for individuals highlighted in your descriptions. The life dates in parentheses should
follow the first mention of the person's name.

- Use b. (abbreviation for born) to indicate that only a birth date is known or if the person is possibly still living.

- Use d. (abbreviation for died) to indicate that only a death date is known.

- Use fl. (abbreviation for flourished) when neither a birth or death date is known but evidence shows that a person "flourished" during
those dates.

## Numbers

Use numerals for centuries.

- :smiley: _She was the first woman to win the prize in the 20th century._

Use numerals for troop numbers.

- :smiley: _He seved with the 1st North Carolina Volunteers._

Spell out numbers 1-12 when they appear singly in text. Use numerals when they represent a numerical span.

- :smiley: _She is known to have eaten twelve blueberry pies at the 1907 state fair._

- :smiley: _Spell out numbers 1-12 when they appear singly in text._

Spell out numbers when they appear at the beginning of sentences (or reconstruct the sentence so that the number does not come first).

- :smiley: _One hundred years later, he was still eating blueberry pie._


# Spaces and Dashes

**One space rules:** Always use ONE space after punctuation (periods, colons, whatever). In an EAD finding aid, there is never a time 
that you need more than one space in a row. 

- :rage: _Smith gave birth to sextuplets in 1983.••They were called:••Manny, Moe, Jack, Eloise, Heloise, and Fran.••In 1984, Smith joined the Foreign Legion._

- :smiley: _Smith gave birth to sextuplets in 1983.•They were called:•Manny, Moe, Jack, Eloise, Heloise, and Fran.•In 1984, Smith joined the Foreign Legion._

**Dashes:** Dashes should not be surrounded by spaces:

- :rage: _1983•-•1984_

- :smiley: _1983-1984_

Extra spaces in and around EAD tags: Extra spaces in and around tags are sometimes hard to see, but you must train yourself to be vigilant. These extra spaces show up in the beginning or middle of statements when the document is displayed in xml or html, resulting in too much space between words or causing misalignment of lists (e.g., online catalog terms, folder number lists, folder titles).

# Civil War letters

When describing a letter written by a Civil War soldier, if possible, include the following in the biographical and scope and content notes:

- the regiment in which the writer served

- if the writer was a soldier or an officer

- where the writer was writing from and where he was writing to (if this is a quick processing job, you can often tell by looking at the very top of the letter and seeing where the writer was positioned—which makes you able to say, for example, that he was writing from Virginia, without reading more in depth)

- what places are referenced in the letters

- what battles are being described

If you are describing the letters in more depth, you can include information about camp life, sickness, death, and other cheerful 
wartime subjects.  


# UNC

**University of North Carolina:** Our institution is currently the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It has been so since 1963. Any materials relating to this institution through 1962 are from the University of North Carolina. For the earlier period, you can also say University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill or University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill if you like. Use the appropriate full form of the name the first time it is mentioned in each section (Collection Overview, series/subseries scope and content notes) so that it can be content tagged with ```<corpname>``` if needed. For subsequent mentions within sections, you can use UNC or UNC-Chapel Hill as appropriate. Do not use UNC-CH. 


# Miscellaneous

**Chair and chairman:** If we agree to use chair for both males and females, we cannot go wrong.

**Correspondence:** _Correspondence_ means an exchange of letters. If we say, _Also included is correspondence between Amos Trevellyan and his daughter Alma,_ we mean that there are letters from Amos to Alma as AND letters from Alma to Amos. Do not use _correspondence_ when there are letters going only one way. If the collection includes chiefly incoming letters and only a few outgoing letters, which may or may not be paired together, _correspondence_ is still the correct term.

- :rage: Included is correspondence Rankin received from supporters.

- :smiley: Included are letters Rankin received from supporters.

**Copies:** Be precise and clear when referring to copies as opposed to original items. Acceptable terms include typed transcriptions, carbon copies, photocopies, photocopies of typed transcriptions, and handwritten copies. Avoid vague terms (e.g., copies). 

**Things southern:** It's the South, not the south. BUT it is southern and southerner, not Southern and Southerner.

- :rage: He was from the south.

- :smiley: He was from the South.

- :rage: We traveled South on the highway.
