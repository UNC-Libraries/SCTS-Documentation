# Saying it

## General rules

**Good writing and editing:** Deathless prose is not required; good concise standard English with a kind and respectful lens is required. In addition to writing new description, be prepared to edit the writing of archivists who have gone before you. Sometimes editing corrects errors; sometimes it clarifies description; other times it remediates offensive language or surfaces voices previously hidden in description. 

**Ethical and inclusive description:** We strive to use conscious language that is kind, compassionate, mindful, empowering, respectful, and inclusive.[^1] In regards to voice and style, we lean heavily on the thoughtful work of our peers and colleagues, especially the [recommendations produced by the Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia (A4BLiP)](https://archivesforblacklives.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ardr_final.pdf): 
- decenter “neutrality” and “objectivity” in favor of “respect” and “care”; 
- avoid passive voice when describing oppressive relationships; 
- use active voice in order to embed responsibility within description; 
- focus on the humanity of an individual before their identity/ies; 
- refrain from writing flowery, valorizing biographical notes for collection creators; 
- use accurate and strong language such as lynching, rape, murder, and hate mail when they are appropriate; 
- describe relationships of power when they are important for understanding the context of records. Racism, slurs, white supremacy, colonialism, and histories of oppression are important context.”[^2] 

**Timeliness of description:** It’s tempting to say things like “Fluffy now lives in Cary, N.C., where she teaches obedience classes.” Although additions or other circumstances will cause some finding aids to be revised in future, many finding aids will represent their collections for years and years. If your description includes statements that talk about what someone’s doing now or where that someone currently lives or how many books she’s written, you risk your description becoming quickly outdated. You can get around this by making the description more oblique and therefore more able to endure the test of time. Some examples are: 

- :smiley: In 2001, Fluffy moved to Cary, N.C., where she taught obedience classes.

- :smiley: As of 1969, she had written 18 novels about cane toads in Australia.

- :smiley: The Hamptons had 24 children, 16 dogs, and 44 goldfish in 2001.

**Consistency:** Please try to be consistent in what you call people, places, things. If she's Mary Virginia del Rio, please don't call her Mary Va. del Rio. Ever. This is important for searchability. 

- :smiley: _Mary Virginia del Rio._

- :smiley: _Mary Va. del Rio._

Also, strive for consistency in punctuation and capitalization. Especially when writing folder titles for University Archives, it is important to be consistent with capitalization throughout our collections. You can become an expert by following a few simple rules. See below for [Commas and Other Punctuation](#commas-and-other-punctuation) and [Capitalization](#capitalization).

**Verb tenses:** Use the present tense when referring to the papers themselves. Use the past tense when referring to actions of the creators or recipients of the papers.

- :smiley: _There are three letters from John to Mary._

- :smiley: _In a letter of 3 June 1870, Amos described his trip to High Point, N.C._

**Say it and say it again:** We don't expect people to read our finding aids from beginning to end. This is especially true of online finding aids, which are designed to help researchers navigate directly to descriptions of the materials of interest. Therefore, repeat important information (e.g., complete names, full titles of writings, when an event took place) in every intellectual component throughout the finding aid.

**Use abbreviations sparingly:** There are only a few cases in which the abbreviation is so well-known that it makes sense to use it.

**BUT verbosity is discouraged:** You’re writing description, not deathless prose. Keep it simple both in sentence structure and vocabulary choice. Again, remember that researchers don't typically read through the whole finding aid beginning to end, but seek out the parts that hold particular interest for them.

# Abstracts, Collection Overview, Biog/Hist notes

## Consciously edited abstracts 

We strive to write ethical and inclusive abstracts that de-center whiteness and give voice to those historically left out of our description. In the context of antebellum collections held at UNC, this includes calling out the names of enslaved individuals whenever possible, refraining from valorizing biographical notes for collection creators, and clearly connecting family and plantation names with slavery. We do this to present history accurately, to add new access points for researchers, and to make our collection description more inclusive by emphasizing the lives and lived experiences of those documented in UNC’s collections.  

We follow the [A4BLiP voice and style guidelines](https://archivesforblacklives.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ardr_final.pdf) (outlined above under [Ethical and inclusive description](####ethical-and-inclusive-description)) and consult our internal [Principles for Ethical Description](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Principles%20for%20Ethical%20Description%20in%20Special%20Collections%20Technical%20Services.md), recommendations for abstract [Descriptive Elements](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Descriptive%20Elements.md), and recommendations for describing racial and ethnic identities (listed in the [PersNames, CorpNames, Racial and ethnic identities, GeogNames, Titles, Dates, Numbers](#persnames-corpnames-racial-and-ethnic-identities-geognames-titles-dates-numbers).  

It is important to note that our recommendations and practice of using conscious language and ethical description extends well beyond the abstract. We try to embed conscious language and ethical description into all facets of our finding aid, but we emphasize these practices in relation to the abstract since this is the primary and often the first point of entry for many researchers. 

## Abstracts and Collection Overviews for Multi-Series Collections

**A good way to write the abstract and collection overview:** 

- Create a collection overview that concisely answers who, what, where, and when about the collection.

- Copy the collection overview into the abstract area `(<abstract encodinganalog="520">)`.

- Edit the abstract so that it's as concise as possible.

- You may include brief biographical/historical information to provide context for the collection but it is no longer required  
(we no longer have this tag in the finding aid: `<abstract encodinganalog="545">`; if you come across this tag in an existing finding aid, you can remove it, with the option of adding the biographical information to the `<abstract encodinganalog="520">` in brief form)

- Review the abstract to make sure that the necessary access points (online catalog headings) can be grounded in it 

## `<Bioghist>` versus `<Scopecontent>`

`<bioghist>` is about the creator(s) of the materials. `<scopecontent>` is about the materials in the collection. It’s sometimes difficult to separate what goes in one from what goes in the other. Try for as little overlap as possible. For example, if you’re working on the papers of a creator who was involved in a particular project and the resulting materials are what’s in the collection, talk about the creator’s background in `<bioghist>`. You can also mention that the creator undertook the project at hand. But save the details of the project for `<scopecontent>`. 

Here’s a short example:

- :smiley: `<bioghist><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Janet and Eugene Anderson are a married African American couple who are health care and civil rights activists in Rossville, Fayette County, Tenn. During the 1970s they hosted Student Health Coalition members from Nashville, Tennessee, and participated in the Poor Peoples Campaign.</p>

<p>Janet Anderson was born 12 January 1949, in Fayette County, Tenn., and attended Fayette County schools. After high school, she went to Lane College (1967-1968) but left to get married and start a family. After her children were older, she got involved in local politics. Starting in the late 1970's, she was a county commissioner, worked as the outreach coordinator for the Tennessee Hunger Coalition, and served alongside Sister Elaine Wicks with the Poor People's Health clinic in Fayette County, Tenn. Her platforms included improving the school system, increasing voter registration, and rural healthcare.</p>

<p>Eugene Anderson, born 3 June 1947 in Fayette County, Tenn., also attended Fayette County public schools. He joined the military and served in the Vietnam War. When he returned home, he worked in the steel industry and finished his career as a union representative for United Steelworkers.</p></bioghist>`

- :smiley: `<scopecontent><head>Collection Overview</head><p>The Janet Anderson and Eugene Anderson Collection documents African American life and culture in rural Fayette County, Tennessee, especially the intersection of African American health crises and civil rights concerns. The collection consists of an interview with Janet and Eugene Anderson in May 2019 in Rossville, Tennessee, and copies of newspaper clippings, photographs, and flyers that supplement their stories about African American health activism in Fayette County. Topics include Tent City (1959-1960); the Appalachian Student Health Coalition in Rossville, Tennessee; the Poor People's Health Council of Rossville, Tennessee in the late 1970s; the Original Fayette County, Tennessee Civic and Welfare League, Inc., in the early 1990s; and Janet Anderson's campaign for Fayette County Court Clerk in 1978.</p></scopecontent>`

## Biographical Note verses Historical Note

Biographical notes are about individuals and families; historical notes are about organizations.


# Folder and Item Lists

Most of the time we will use creator-generated folder and item lists, and we will preserve the original order in which we received the materials, which often are in chronological or alphabetical order. Ideally the creator will supply us with an electronic version of the folder or item list, but even then there are some general rules to follow with regard to punctuation and capitalization in folder titles. See below for more about [Commas and Other Punctuation](#commas-and-other-punctuation) and [Capitalization](#capitalization) throughout the finding aid. Guidance for transcribing titles and captions follows.

## Creator-generated folder titles 
We privilege creator-generated folder titles. Add a processing note just before the folder list begins when you are using folder titles as received:

- :smiley: _Note that original file folder titles have, for the most part, been retained._

- :smiley: _The creator's/organization's original arrangement has been retained. Folder titles were derived from original folder names and from descriptive metadata found within the files by the processing archivist._

HOWEVER, take that statement with a grain of salt: Make the list as intelligible as you can without fretting over the contents of each folder. You may have to spell out abbreviations or take a quick look to see what some weird combination of letters and numbers means.

The creator may have been creative with names, punctuation, date style, etc., but you must strive for consistency. Making the creator's folder titles conform to our style is usually just a question of re-ordering the words. Do not hesitate to do this. It's okay to list names in first name, last name order or last name, first name order, but you should pick one and do it consistently throughout the listing.

## Folder list order
Folder order should have some kind of logic. Alphabetical or chronological order should be easily discerned. Any other order should make sense in terms of the papers. You are under no obligation to include an `<arrangement>` statement. If there is no discernible order (especially in short folder lists), leave the `<arrangement>` statement out.  

Alphabetical by name means Last name, First name.

- :smiley: _Bushyhead, Robert H._

Company names that include a person’s name are alphabetized by the first letter of the first word in the name.  

- :smiley: _J. M. Dent and Sons_

## Punctuation within folder titles

Do not end folder titles with a period.

- :smiley: _Steele, Danielle_

Use colons to show subordination. Capitalize first word after colon.

- :smiley: _Missionary Society: Committee on Part-time Missionaries_

- :smiley: _1901: January-March_

Always use commas before dates:

- :smiley: _Missionary Society: Minutes, 1901-1903_

- :smiley: _Correspondence, 1901-1902_

Use commas before locations:

- :smiley: _Missionary Society: Annual meeting, Raleigh, 1902_

Use colons in complex statements:

- :smiley: `<title render="doublequote">How the West Was Won</title>:` _Missionary Society, Raleigh, 1966_

You may want to use the subordination model cited above when you want to list genre and dates for some folders and genre with 
modifying information for other folders. For example, a series may contain correspondence, 1901-1956; speeches for which you have both titles and dates; and miscellaneous other items. Remembering that you use a simple comma before locations and before dates, the folder list would look like this:  

- :smiley: _Correspondence, 1903-1956_

- :smiley: _Speech: `<title render="doublequote">How I Spent My Summer Vacation</title>,` Raleigh, 1922_

- :smiley: _Speech: `<title render="doublequote">How the West Was Won</ title>:` Civitan Club, Chapel Hill, 1960_


Use the Last name, First name format:

- :smiley: _Clark, Septima Poinsette_

## Capitalization of folder titles

Unless they are proper nouns or formal titles, only capitalize the first word of a folder title. 

- :smiley: _Folder 21 Annual reports_

- :rage: _Folder 21 Annual Reports_


## Transcribing Titles and Captions

If an unpublished item, such as a photograph or home movie, has a title or caption written on it, we will likely want to replicate that title in the finding aid. We will want to distinguish between titles and captions that come with items (creator-generated information) from the titles and explanations that we provide (archivist-generated information). To do this, we use quotations marks. See [Processing Information](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Descriptive%20Elements.md#processing-information) in Descriptive Elements section for guidance on how to communicate transparently in the finding aid about creator-generated and archivist-generated folder titles.  

Examples:

**Creator-generated title**

For example, a photograph with "Cullom Hall, 1926" written on the back:  

`<unittitle><title render="doublequote">Cullom Hall, 1926</title></unittitle>` 

**Archivist-generated title**

For example, a photograph that we identify as being Cullom Hall in 1926:  

`<unittitle>Cullom Hall, 1926</unittitle>`  

**Creator-generated title with archivist-generated clarification**

For example, a photograph with "Dean Hall" written on the back but we know that building has been re-named Holdzkom Hall:  

`<unittitle><title render="doublequote">Dean Hall</title> (now Holdzkom Hall)</unittitle>`  

**Creator-generated caption**

For example, a photograph that we identify as being Cullom Hall in 1926 that has "Be sure to notice the elephant in the background"
written on the back:  

`<unittitle>Cullom Hall, 1926</unittitle></did><scopecontent><p>Caption reads: <emph render="doublequote">Be sure to notice the elephant in the background.</emph></p></scopecontent>`  

**Archivist-generated caption**

For example, a photograph that we identify as being Cullom Hall in 1926, includes a person we identify as Edward Cullom standing on 
front steps (not noted in original descriptions provided by creator):  

`<unittitle>Cullom Hall, 1926</unittitle></did> <scopecontent><p>Image includes Edward Cullom.</p></scopecontent>`


# Punctuation

## Commas

**Introductory phrases and clauses:** Use a comma to set off all introductory phrases and clauses.

- :smiley: _In December 1980, she totally freaked out._

- :smiley: _By the following summer, she was the CEO for a leading corporation._

**Terms in series:** In a series of three or more terms, use a comma after each term.

- :smiley: _She traveled to Raleigh, Atlanta, and Memphis._

**Names as modifiers:** With appositives involving names, add a comma when the full name is used. Leave the comma out when only part
of a name is used.

- :smiley: _His wife, Mary Johnson Smith, marched for women's suffrage in 1906._

- :smiley: _His daughter Sue was an activist for civil rights in the 1930s._

**Other modifiers:** Use commas before and after location names used as modifiers but not before and after Jr./Sr.

- :smiley: _Goodman moved to Brooklyn, N.Y., in August 1900._

- :smiley: _Ken Griffey Jr. never attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill._

**Quotation marks:** Commas and periods go inside quotes, while colons and semi-colons go outside quotes. Check this carefully when
doing EAD markup.

- :smiley: _She called herself_ `<emph render="doublequote">Lil,</emph>` _but everyone knew her as Nancy._

- :smiley: _Included is the 1922 version of his unsold novel,_ `<title render="doublequote">When Bad Things Happen to Bad People</title>;` _his unsold short story,_ `<title render="doublequote">Worser and Worser</title>;` _and his unsold anthology,_ `<title render="doublequote">Major Works.</title>`  

## Dashes

Dashes should not be surrounded by spaces:

- :rage: _1983•-•1984_

- :smiley: _1983-1984_

## Spaces

**One space rules:** Always use ONE space after punctuation (periods, colons, whatever). In an EAD finding aid, there is never a time that you need more than one space in a row. 

- :rage: _Smith gave birth to sextuplets in 1983.••They were called:••Manny, Moe, Jack, Eloise, Heloise, and Fran.••In 1984, Smith joined the Foreign Legion._

- :smiley: _Smith gave birth to sextuplets in 1983.•They were called:•Manny, Moe, Jack, Eloise, Heloise, and Fran.•In 1984, Smith joined the Foreign Legion._

Extra spaces in and around EAD tags: Extra spaces in and around tags are sometimes hard to see, but you must train yourself to be vigilant. These extra spaces show up in the beginning or middle of statements when the document is displayed in xml or html, resulting in too much space between words or causing misalignment of lists (e.g., online catalog terms, folder number lists, folder titles). Extra spaces at the ends of statements do not show up, but are discouraged.  

- :rage: `<bioghist><head>Biographical Note</head><p> Helen Maynor Scheirbeck (1935-2010), born in Lumberton, N.C., was a political scientist, educator, and community organizer.••</p>`_

- :smiley: `<bioghist><head>Biographical Note</head>`_Helen Maynor Scheirbeck (1935-2010), born in Lumberton, N.C., was a political scientist, educator, and community organizer._

- :rage: `<unittitle>•<unitdate>1922</unitdate></unittitle>`

- :smiley: `<unittitle><unitdate>1922</unitdate></unittitle>`

- :rage: `<c02><did><container type="folder">•1</container><unittitle>Correspondence, <unitdate type="inclusive">1920-1939</unitdate></unittitle></did></c02>`

- :rage: `<c02><did><container type="folder">1</container><unittitle>•Correspondence, <unitdate type="inclusive">1920-1939</unitdate></unittitle></did></c02>`

- :smiley: `<c02><did><container type="folder">1</container><unittitle>Correspondence, <unitdate type="inclusive">1920-1939</unitdate></unittitle></did></c02>`

# PersNames, CorpNames, Racial and ethnic identities, GeogNames, Titles, Dates, Numbers 

## PersNames and CorpNames

**Consistency:** Try to be consistent in how you write names. It is often best to use the fullest version of the name first in each section of your EAD finding aid (e.g., abstracts, biographical/historical note, collection overview, c01 series descriptions). In subsequent references within each section, you may use either the last name alone (unless this makes for unclear references) or the most-used combination of given and surname. If the appropriate name is _Hetty Betty Bodine_, you may refer to her as _Bodine_ or _Hetty Betty Bodine_ or perhaps _Hetty Bodine_ or _Hetty_. Do not, however, arbitrarily start calling her _Hetty B. Bodine_ or _H. Betty Bodine_ or _Betty_ (unless she went by _Betty_, in which case, use that name consistently).

When an individual uses initials in a personal name, place a period followed by a space after each letter. 

- J. G. de Roulhac Hamilton

**Abbreviations:** Usually spell out names of corporate bodies. There can be exceptions, but this will be determined on a case-by-case basis, often according to whether or not there is an authority record for a name. For example, use "and" instead of "&" unless you know that the authority record specifies & (remember to use & for & in EAD-encoded finding aids).  

- :smiley: _University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill_

- :smiley: _Smith and Company_

## United States or U.S.

Do not abbreviate for major government bodies and officials.

- United States Congress

- United States Senate

- United States Senator

- United States Representative

- United States Supreme Court

Abbreviate for lesser government bodies and for military units

- U.S. War Labor Board

- U.S. Farm Security Administration

- U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

## Racial and Ethnic Identities 

In our abstracts we list out racial and ethnic identities of creator, collectors, and major figures documented in collections so that whiteness is no longer the presumed default of the people represented in our collections (please see the abstract section of [Descriptive Elements](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Descriptive%20Elements.md) for more on this established practice). Below is a list of preferred terms to describe an individual or group of individuals racial and ethnic identity. This is an evolving and living list of recommendations. It is not exhaustive. We consulted our colleagues and peers, including the “The Diversity Style Guide” [^3], when compiling these recommended racial and ethnic identities. Please note that we do not hyphenate racial and ethnic identities and that we capitalize all identities, except for “white”. As noted in Descriptive Elements, we encourage those described or the decedents of those described to please let us know how they would like to be identified and/or when we have misidentified individuals or groups. 

- African 

- African American  

- Afro-Caribbean 

- American Indian 

- Asian American 

- Black 

- Cambodian American 

- Central Asian 

- Chinese American 

- Coharie Indian 

- Creole 

- Cuban 

- Cuban American 

- East Indian Americans 

- Greek American 

- Haitian American 

- Haliwa-Saponi Indian 

- Hispanic [stick to Latinx?] 

- Japanese American 

- Jewish 

- Jewish American 

- Latinx 

- Lumbee Indian 

- Mexican American 

- Montagnard 

- Multiracial American [preferably list out: European, African American, and Native American ancestry.] 

- Native American [preferably we would use specifics when available: Coharie Indian; Haliwa-Saponi Indian; Lumbee Indian; Tuscarora Indian] 

- South Asian 

- Tuscarora Indian 

- Vietnamese American 

- white 

We acknowledge that race and ethnic identity is only one facet of an individual’s or group of individuals’ identity and that above all else we must emphasize the humanity of those being described. We do this through voice and style. An example from the A4BLiP:  

Consider the difference between “documents the business dealings of a Black woman named Maria in 18th century Mexico” and “documents the business dealings of Maria, a Black woman in 18th century Mexico. [^4]  

Additional examples from UNC finding aids below: 

- William R. Ferris, white folklorist, author, professor, and filmmaker of Vicksburg, Miss. 

- Roberta H. Jackson, African American professor of education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 

- Helen Maynor Scheirbeck (1935-2010), a Lumbee Indian political scientist, educator, and community organizer born in Lumberton, N.C. 

- Psi Delta Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, the first historically Black Greek organization established at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 

- Videotapes created by Judith McWillie, a white artist, author, and professor emeritus of drawing and painting at the Lamar Dodd School of Art in Athens, Ga. 

- Etta Baker, born Etta Lucille Reid, claimed European, African American, and Native American ancestry. 

- Interview conducted by Molly Conrecode, a white folklorist, with Bland Simpson, a white author, playwright, songwriter, and musician, who was a member of the North Carolina string band, the Red Clay Ramblers. 

## GeogNames

Abbreviate a state name when it directly follows the name of a city or a county (parish). Otherwise spell out the name of the state.

**Abbreviations:** Always use the approved Library of Congress state abbreviations when the state is a modifier. Note that these are NOT the 2-letter standard United States Post Office abbreviations. Note also that there is no space between N. and C. (N.C.) or S. and C. (S.C.) or W. and Va. (W.Va.).

## Titles (published works)

Use `<title>` tags to add italics or quotation marks to formal titles; use `<emph>` tags to add bold, italic, or quotation marks in all other cases.

**Italics:** Use italics for published books, pamphlets; proceedings, collections of materials (e.g., short story collections, poetry collections), long poems, periodicals, and newspapers (including newspaper sections published separately). Also use italics for motion pictures; major musical works (e.g., operas, symphonies), paintings, drawings, statues, and other works of art. Make sure the `</title>` tag comes before any ending punctuation. 

- :smiley: _In his_ `<title render="italic">Dictionary of North Carolina Biography</title>,` _Powell ..._

- :smiley: _Her column appeared in the_ `<title render="italic">Charlotte News</title>,` _1942-1953._

- :smiley: _He wrote for the_ `<title render="italic">New York Times Book Review</title>` _regularly between 1966 and 1970._

- :smiley: _His poetry collection,_ `<title render="italic">Call of the Wildest</title>` _(Oxford, 1951), won the North Carolina Weird Poetry Society award in 1952._

- :smiley: _He wrote extensively about seeing a production of_ `<title render="italic">The Emperor Jones</title>` _in 1939._

**Quotation marks:** Use quotation marks for theses, dissertations, short stories, short poems, chapters, journal and newspaper articles, columns, and all unpublished works regardless of length. Make sure the `</title>` tag comes before or after punctuation as appropriate.

- :smiley: _His novel,_ `<title render="doublequote">Wilder West,</title>` _was never published._

- :smiley: _Her column,_ `<title render="doublequote">Little Moi,</title>` _appeared in the_ `<title render="italic">Chapel Hill Messenger</title>,` _1909-1910._

- :smiley: _His poem,_ `<title render="doublequote">Now There Are None</title>` _won the Minor Poets of Portland award in 1902._

## `<Title>` versus `<Emph>`

`<title>` and `<emph>` result in the same outputs to the screen, but they're not the same intellectually. `<title>` is for titles, italic or quoted; `<emph>` supplies italic or quotation marks in all other cases. Most of the time, you'll have a title. Examples of correct `<emph>` usage include:  

- :smiley: _The letter indicates that she was_ `<emph render="doublequote">goosed</emph>` _by the soldier._

- :smiley: _In the letter from Gettysburg, Penn., dated 3 July 1863, he wrote,_ `<emph render="doublequote">What the <emph render="italic">HELL</emph> am I doing here?</emph>`

- :smiley: _Her name was McGill, and she called herself_ `<emph render="doublequote">Lil,</emph>` _but everyone knew her as_ `<emph render="doublequote">Nancy.</emph>` 

## Dates

**General:** Dates style is as follows. No commas, please.

- :smiley: _23 April 1876_

- :smiley: _April 1876_

**Centuries:** Use Arabic numerals for centuries. Include a hyphen if the century is used as an adjective.

- :smiley: _19th century_

- :smiley: _20th century_

- :smiley: _10th century_

- :smiley: _18th-century politics_

Numberical representations of centuries DO NOT have an apostrophe.

- :smiley: 1800s NOT 1800's

**Date spans:** Never use a from without a to.

- :rage: _She was fire chief from 1906-1920._

- :smiley: _She was fire chief from 1906 to 1920._

- :smiley: _She was fire chief, 1906-1920._

**Life dates:** You should provide life dates for individuals highlighted in your descriptions. The life dates in parentheses should
follow the first mention of the person's name.

- Use b. (abbreviation for born) to indicate that only a birth date is known or if the person is possibly still living.

- Use d. (abbreviation for died) to indicate that only a death date is known.

- Use fl. (abbreviation for flourished) when neither a birth or death date is known but evidence shows that a person "flourished" during
those dates.

## Numbers

Use numerals for centuries.

- :smiley: _She was the first woman to win the prize in the 20th century._

Use numerals for troop numbers.

- :smiley: _He served with the 1st North Carolina Volunteers._

Spell out numbers 1-12 when they appear singly in text. Use numerals when they represent a numerical span.

- :smiley: _She is known to have eaten twelve blueberry pies at the 1907 state fair._

- :smiley: _Spell out numbers 1-12 when they appear singly in text._

Spell out numbers when they appear at the beginning of sentences (or reconstruct the sentence so that the number does not come first).

- :smiley: _One hundred years later, he was still eating blueberry pie._



# Miscellaneous

**University of North Carolina:** Our institution is currently the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It has been so since 1963. Any materials relating to this institution through 1962 are from the University of North Carolina. For the earlier period, you can also say University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill or University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill if you like. Use the appropriate full form of the name the first time it is mentioned in each section (Collection Overview, series/subseries scope and content notes) so that it can be content tagged with `<corpname>` if needed. For subsequent mentions within sections, you can use UNC or UNC-Chapel Hill as appropriate. Do not use UNC-CH. 

**Chair and chairman:** If we agree to use chair for both males and females, we cannot go wrong.

**Correspondence:** _Correspondence_ means an exchange of letters. If we say, _Also included is correspondence between Amos Trevellyan and his daughter Alma,_ we mean that there are letters from Amos to Alma as AND letters from Alma to Amos. Do not use _correspondence_ when there are letters going only one way. If the collection includes chiefly incoming letters and only a few outgoing letters, which may or may not be paired together, _correspondence_ is still the correct term.

- :rage: Included is correspondence Rankin received from supporters.

- :smiley: Included are letters Rankin received from supporters.

**Copies:** Be precise and clear when referring to copies as opposed to original items. Acceptable terms include typed transcriptions, carbon copies, photocopies, photocopies of typed transcriptions, handwritten copies, and dubs (for audiovisual materials). Avoid vague terms (e.g., copies). 

# Historical Documentation

How we process archival collections has evolved over time. Since implementation of a local version of More Product, Less Process (MPLP), we have significantly curtailed the depth to which we describe collection materials. Included here is descriptive guidance that is not wrong, but it is generally not in active use because we are not doing in-depth processing.

- [Literary Papers](#literary-papers)


## Military Papers

When describing an oral history of or a letter written by a soldier, if possible, include the following in the biographical and scope and content notes:

- the regiment in which the writer served

- if the writer was a soldier or an officer

- where the writer was writing from and where he was writing to (if this is a quick processing job, you can often tell by looking at the very top of the letter and seeing where the writer was positioned—which makes you able to say, for example, that he was writing from Virginia, without reading more in depth)

- what places are referenced in the letters or oral history

- what battles are being described

If you are describing the letters in more depth, you can include information about camp life, sickness, death, and other cheerful wartime subjects.
