## Background

Wilson Library has a large collection of slavery era family papers, some of which document the lives and lived experiences of enslaved and free Black people. Description of these materials in finding aids and catalog records historically has privileged the lives and perspectives of the white families represented in the collections; moreover, this description typically was created with a scholarly audience in mind. Slavery was to be studied as an institution, but the humanity of individual enslaved people was rarely recognized. At this time, Special Collections Technical Services archivists and catalogers are beginning to redress this unbalanced representation and repair exclusionary language in finding aids and catalog records. This project was an opportunity to explore how we can expand our efforts to improve these descriptive tools to facilitate the research experience of family historians who are specifically interested in marginalized and underrepresented groups.

Our project goals have centered building our understanding of the research process and experience of genealogists and researchers of African American family history in a general sense and at Wilson Special Collections Library in particular. We also hoped to establish initial relationships with the interviewees with the possibility of returning to them as consultants for further conversations about the descriptive work we are doing in Technical Services. 

## The Interviews

Between March and October 2022 we conducted zoom interviews with ten genealogists and researchers of African American family history, spending about an hour with each interviewee. We brought a standard set of questions to each interview, but proceeded with each as more of a conversation. We wanted to listen and go in whatever directions our interviewees led us.

- **What led you to start doing genealogical research?** 
- **Can you tell us about your research process?** 
- **Can you share a highlight of your genealogical research experience?** 
- **Can you share a low point in your genealogical research experience?** 
- **Do you have any suggestions for how Wilson Library can facilitate YOUR research?** 
- **Anything else you would like to share with us about African American genealogical and family research?**

## What led you to start doing genealogical research?  

We learned that many of our interviewees came to genealogical and family research by way of family reunions and gatherings where the elders always had a gravitational pull on the young and old family members who were already interested in their history. The interviewees grew up in a context in which family wanted to hear the stories that had been passed down one generation to the next. Sometimes there were photographs on the wall and scrapbooks with obituaries, wedding bulletins, and other markers of life events to look at. Several interviewees reported that their mothers and grandmothers were the family historians and it was natural for them to join the journey. Shelley Murphy told us that her grandmother was always telling stories and her mother was always asking follow-up questions. Carmen White told us that as a child she listened to the stories of her elders and she watched Queen and Who Do You Think You Are. She got going in her own genealogical research when she was in graduate school.

We also heard that interviewees wanted to know more about their living extended family. Kathy Atwater told us she wanted to bring family together by making connections, by recognizing family traits and behaviors that show up across generations in the family tree. For Kathy, the pandemic really brought home for her the importance of knowing about and connecting with family.

For others, a specific incident inspired action. Renate Yarborough Sanders started doing family research with a passion after writing an obituary for her father and realizing she wanted to know more about his side of the family.

Shelley and Ellen Fernandez-Sacco told us that one of the major motivating forces to keep going in family research is to write ancestors into history. Shelley wants history to know that “we came from somebody…we were here, we contributed.”

## Can you tell us about your research process? 

We heard from several interviewees that they start with what they know, perhaps creating a family tree or timeline to visually sort out that information, and then often the first searches are on Ancestry or Family Search. Ashley Adams started in Ancestry with the name of her grandfather who served in the military, and then found that she could build a narrative of his military journey--where he was posted and for how long.

Most everyone also uses finding aids, library catalogs, google searches, newspapers.com, city directories, and other databases and websites[^1], and will keyword search on “slavery” with family surnames, city and county locations, local terms (some of which are offensive), as well as subject headings such as Slavery—[geographic location]. Bernetiae Reed offered valuable critique of subject headings, cautioning us of their limitations to non-expert searchers. Researchers may click on a subject heading within a finding aid expecting to be taken to related content somewhere in the finding aid, rather than back to the catalog to a list of other library materials—archival and non-archival—that share the same heading.

Nicka Sewell-Smith starts with the people who are living and works backward, then asks about location and time period: when and how did people come to live and work in this place, what else was going on, and what archival resources does that state/location have that might answer those questions? Olivia Dorsey Peacock and Ellen Fernandez-Sacco similarly expand their research with context-driven searches: instead of looking for people, Olivia sometimes searches for information that is adjacent to people, such as places and institutions[^2]; Ellen uses general and local histories, church histories, and memoirs to enhance her understanding of context.

Renate Yarborough Sanders also uses older websites like [Afrigeneas](https://www.afrigeneas.com/) to search discussion boards. She and others emphasized the community of people researching African American ancestors as a source of expertise, as well as social and emotional support. Renate never expected to be a part of this community, but now is a regular participant in online genealogical groups, including Freedmen's Bureau Fridays, which is led by Shelley Murphy on zoom. Ellen Fernandez-Sacco echoed the impossibility of doing genealogical research by oneself. She also turns to Facebook groups for community and to the [Latino Genealogy and Beyond](https://latinogenealogyandbeyond.com/) blog. And of course we would be remiss in not pointing out [BlackProGen](https://www.whoisnickasmith.com/blackprogen/), the online community hosted by Nicka Sewell-Smith and supported by many of the interviewees with whom we spoke, including Olivia Dorsey Peacock who first mentioned this group to us and then recruited many of the other interviewees for this project.

Several interviewees emphasized the importance of tracking and organizing research discoveries. Shelley Murphy suggested creating a path of questions and recording who gave what information. Both Shelley and Olivia Dorsey Peacock are big on timelines as an organizing principle. Shelley makes notes on what kinds of records exist for that time period in that state, and what records exist because of the laws that were in place. Olivia has created (and shares out) a spreadsheet with rows representing events in a timeline and columns used for citations and other information.

## Can you share a highlight of your genealogical research experience? 

Highlights were both general and specific. Carmen White told us that “basically all my highlights are just finding the stories of my ancestors that were in somebody's basement." Likewise, Renate Yarborough Sanders said that a highlight is any time you find something about an ancestor. 

Ashley Adams told us about her mother’s research finding that an aunt was born on Cherokee land, which explained why the family had some long ties to the land when no one could remember how that came to be. Renate Yarborough Sanders found a cohabitation record and confirmation of enslavement for her great grandparents, Calvin and Precilla Yarborough. She raised the question of how should one think about a single document that says both a little and a lot about the circumstances of their lives.

Ellen Fernandez-Sacco was alone in citing teaching others to do genealogical research as a highlight, but clearly on some level she speaks for all the interviewees. Olivia Dorsey Peacock took time to tell us how motivated she is to share her methodology with others, and how she feels responsible for recruiting the next generation of people who will study Black family history.

## Can you share a low point in your genealogical research experience? 

We heard about low points in more general terms. We were told multiple times that this kind of research is not impossible: the 1870 brick wall is a “myth” according to Shelley Murphy; and Olivia Dorsey Peacock is committed to removing the “myth” that you can’t find your people if they are Black. However, there are road blocks that can temporarily discourage and deflate. Ellen Fernandez-Sacco told us that her low point is the waiting for the breakthrough. Renate Yarborough Sanders shared that “the more you research, the harder it gets to find new information.” Ashley Adams mentioned the frustration of running into the same information again and again in different places, and the challenge of variant spellings, or the frequency of the same last names across Black and white racial groups. Carmen White told us that when she hits a blocker she switches back and forth between DNA matches and documents to find new leads. Shelley Murphy also has turned to DNA to help get past her very common last name to new leads in her family research.

Renate Yarborough Sanders also described low points of a more existential nature: realizing that you have a lot of documents but not pictures or a lot of stories to tell, and realizing that your family is not as interested as you are in what information that you do have to share. Needless to say, sadness does not stop the search for family history.

Shelley Murphy offered a more mystical perspective, telling us that sometimes when you are ready to receive the information it will come to you through ancestor-guided research.

## Do you have any suggestions for how Wilson Library can facilitate YOUR research? 

We heard so many great ideas for ways to reach out and support the researchers of African American family history audience, especially the newer researchers, which is yet another example of how generous this group of interviewees was with their expertise. A lot of the suggestions revolved around demystifying researching African American family history. It goes without saying that this research is challenging. Shelley Murphy helped us to think about why that is, reminding us that not only did Black people not create records, they were subject to the laws that expressly kept them out of records. Nicka Sewell-Smith put it bluntly: "I have to constantly remind myself and other people that enslaved people were at the mercy of other folks to document them. And so, what are the ways that we can remedy where their voice is silent, like how can we do that now, and what are the ways that we may continue to silence their voices based on how our current language is being executed.” A lot of the suggestions boil down to the Library simply doing its best to guide people to the records that we do have and being thoughtful around the language and emphasis in our descriptive tools.

We are sharing below the comments and suggestions we heard, and in some instances we are able to provide description of our current practices and projects that were influenced or validated by the interviews.

### Staff assistance

When it comes to research assistance from the library, several interviewees said they would go around and around before asking for help, and when they did seek assistance there was a strong preference for live contact, either in person or by phone, instead of by email. Phone is preferred because you feel seen/heard by someone who can help; email doesn't feel as connected and sometimes the response brings an avalanche of information that is hard to make sense of because it is being delivered from someone else’s perspective. One interviewee was hesitant to ask for too much, wanting to be seen as a “good” visitor.
We heard kudos to the pandemic staff who digitized and emailed documents. 

### Outreach

- **An introduction to archives class for genealogists working on Black family history projects at Wilson Library and other special collections repositories.** 
Khadija McNair told us that part of her work at Historic Stagville, a cultural site in Durham County, N.C., dedicated to telling the history of the plantation from the perspective of the enslaved people, is explaining to descendants how to navigate the archive to find their ancestors. An in-person class could help explain how a special collections library/archive works and how to use finding aids, catalog records, and other search tools. 
- **A libguide for researchers of African American family history who are working in Wilson Library collections**
Shelley Murphy suggested that we explain to researchers how to interact with our collections. If they have made it to a special collections library, they already have a good handle on how to do genealogical research, but they may benefit from guidance on how to understand the finding aids we have. What can they expect to see in finding aids that historically have focused on the white family? Where should one look for documentation of enslaved people when it hasn’t been called out directly? For example, we can tell researchers to look for wills and tax lists, but where and how do they look if these materials have not been called out directly in the finding aid? Renate Yarborough Sanders suggested a glossary of search terms that could help researchers navigate old and new terminology and language revisions, such as slaves and enslaved people, hiring out and trafficking.
- **Walk-through video of the Wilson website and finding aids**
Ashley Adams had novice researchers in mind, especially students, when she suggested a walk-through video of the website and our finding aids, explaining where you go to find what you are looking for, how to do research, and/or how a finding aid works. She encouraged pro-active, front-facing efforts to let researchers know we are there to help. She made the point that there is a lot of information out there and it can be easy to get lost and be overwhelmed: students need help to know not just how to do research, but also how to know when to stop researching, and how to recognize what is not of use. 

> Comment: Undergraduate students at UNC Chapel Hill typically get an introduction to Wilson Library through classes and assignments that have been coordinated through our Research and Instruction department. Other researchers who are new to Wilson Library can participate in a consultation interview with Research and Instruction staff before they come to the Library for in person research. 

> Comment: Renate Yarborough Sanders recorded her own walk-through of our website and shared it with us: [https://youtu.be/0N18dQphXZ0](https://youtu.be/0N18dQphXZ0). This is a great reminder that some researchers may learn better with a self-paced activity or need an introduction outside of business hours of the Library.

- **Genealogist center**
Bernetiae Reed would like to see a center with dedicated resources and staff. Nicka Sewell-Smith mentioned appreciation for repositories where there are staff members who deeply know a collection and can tell you things about it. 

> Comment: One of our Research and Instruction colleagues, Sarah Carrier, does a lot of supporting research for researchers of African American family history; however, this is not her only or primary responsibility. As an example of her deep dive work, she has been researching Wilson and November Caldwell, two people formerly enslaved by the University of North Carolina, to expand what the Library can share out about these individuals whose descendants are part of the Chapel Hill community. 

### Researcher experience

- **We can be even more welcoming by using more casual language when we are inviting feedback or questions.**

> Comment: Is there a better way to convey in our finding aids that we really do want to hear from the researchers?

- **Settling into research at a new archive can take 45 minutes.** 

> Comment: Are there more ways we can make the settling in process feel comfortable and productive? Does the [FAQ](https://library.unc.edu/wilson/visit/) need any updates from the researcher perspective?

- **Make patrons feel welcome, no matter whether they are remote or in person. For example, there should be capacity for online payment transactions if requesting digitization or copies.**
- **Special collections libraries can feel intimidating. Is there a dedicated staff member there to help genealogists?**
- **Can the Library facilitate better and more parking for folks with disabilities?**

### Digitization

- **We need to get as much as we can online to improve access for so many more people. Ellen Fernandez-Sacco reminded us that people are unable to travel for many reasons—time, distance, expense, and disability.[^3] Seeking family history should not be limited to able-bodied people with disposable income. As Ellen said, the experience of discovering your history should not be kept from anyone because “Keeping people from their history is a really easy way to keep people down.” Renate Yarborough Sanders simply encouraged us to keep digitizing everything we have about people of color from the slavery era.**

> Comment: We have an ongoing digitization stream that is focused on digitizing slavery era collection materials. What else do researchers want or need to know about the digitization program at Wilson Library? Is more transparency needed to understand what gets digitized and why?

- **Item level metadata is desirable to reduce barriers to discovery, but it is not necessary. Researchers of African American family history are accustomed to deep dives into records; they do not expect this work to be easy and they understand how expensive and resource intensive it is to create item level metadata.**

> Comment: We are trying to make that work a little bit easier by applying “records of enslavement” as a metadata term at the folder level so that researchers can do more targeted searching.

### Database

Bernetiae Reed envisions a future in which information about enslaved people in a finding aid is linked to a digitized document of record and points to a spreadsheet or database that brings together all the contextual information about enslaved people who are documented in the collections at Wilson Library. A researcher could search by an enslaved person’s name, a plantation, an enslaver, etc. This dataset should be compatible with larger projects such as [Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade](http://www.enslaved.org/), a discovery hub that aggregates datasets and digital projects with documentation of enslaved people, and [On These Grounds](https://onthesegrounds.org/s/OTG/page/about), a multi-site project to develop a shared data model for collecting, organizing, and describing historical records about enslaved people at universities. 

> Comment: This is one of the big decision points that we will have in the future. For now, when possible, we are adding information about individual enslaved people to the finding aid. When adding names is not feasible, we are highlighting that documentation of individuals is available and where to look for it in the collection. We will return to the bigger picture of spreadsheets and databases when we have more information from our colleagues working with [On These Grounds](https://onthesegrounds.org/s/OTG/page/about).

### Connection building

Nicka Sewell-Smith urged that any projects around slavery should work to put connections together, to cross pollenate information (as [Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade](http://www.enslaved.org/) does). When we silo off information, we don't acknowledge the enormity of the system of slavery. She gave an example of her own research in which she started at the Mississippi State Archives, but a note about connections to Harvard University and Amherst College sent her to those repositories where she ultimately found the information she was seeking. Highlighting the interconnectedness of families is helpful.

> Comment: We do have a “Related Collections” section in our finding aids that points to other collections in our Library and occasionally to collections in other Libraries. We could use [ArchiveGrid](https://researchworks.oclc.org/archivegrid/), an aggregation of descriptions of archival material at more than 1000 institutions, to be more expansive in identifying related slavery era collections beyond our own library. We also contribute to [Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC)](https://snaccooperative.org/), an international database that is designed to bring together information about archival materials related to individuals, families, and corporate bodies.

### Catalog navigation

Bernetiae Reed gave us some feedback based on her vast research experience in our library catalog (and others). She reports that the number of clicks (minimum of 4) to get to the finding aid after entering a search term is excessive. She asks if the abstract could be visible with the collection title in the search returns so that it would be easier to rule in or rule out a collection before committing to the 4 clicks. Similarly, is it possible to see the keywords in contextual excerpts before committing to clicking all the way into the finding aid?[^4]

> Comment: We are migrating our finding aids to ArchivesSpace, a content platform that will allow researchers to search more easily across all of our finding aids. The search results page will display the collection name and the initial portion of the abstract with keywords in context.[^5] The catalog search will not change.

### Finding aids

We were told that researchers of African American family history are willing to read through very long finding aids for discovery, but it would be nice if the finding aids enticed the reader. Shelley Murphy encouraged us to highlight material of interest to Black family history researchers up front in the finding aid. Tell the researcher why this collection/series/folder could be really useful for people researching African American lived experience.

Bernetiae Reed and Nicka Sewell-Smith stated that the more we drill down in the description, the better: include buyer, seller, location, names, ages, details around county, places, and where the transaction takes place. On location Nicka emphasized that all of the context matters: you have to know where you are, how people came to live there, when they were there, and what was going on. Carmen White spoke to the same need for specificity around the movement of people: who are the enslaved people, the slave traders and the business partners; to where were the enslaved people trafficked and with whom? She likes having an executive summary (abstracts and collection overviews) but wants all the context we can give because sometimes she is searching for places that no longer exist, and if there are clues they will be in the details. Finding aids are a place to learn information that doesn't exist elsewhere.

> Comment: Some of our earliest versions of finding aids for slavery era collections were inventories with item level description that was rich in detail. Over decades we have replaced them with finding aids that follow more current practices for archival description. Some details were set aside in service of guiding researchers to understand the overall scope of the collection, helping them to see the forest and a few of the trees, instead of all of the trees. We are now making those original inventories available as PDFs that we can link to from the finding aid in order to give researchers the forest AND the trees.[^6] 

> Comment: We are adding more plantation names and geographic locations.

> Comment: We are highlighting formats, making sure that they are included in catalog records, finding aids, and as part of the metadata of digitized collection material. 

- **Lists of enslaved people = Enslaved persons—[geographic location]—Registers**
- **Slave bills of sale--[geographic location]**

> Comment: At the folder level we are adding “Records of enslavement include:” to highlight individual items that document enslaved people.[^7]

Carmen White told us it would be helpful to new researchers to say at the beginning of the finding aid that there are records of enslaved people here. Nicka Sewell-Smith suggested a visual that would be on the collection description the whole time to keep reminding the researcher that “Hey guys there's gonna be some crazy stuff or you might see some crazy stuff just heads up." This is a good reminder that jarring content can turn up almost anywhere in a slavery era collection.

> Comment: We are in the process of adding a banner to every finding aid for collections with slavery era records. The banner will include a brief statement about slavery era collections and a link to more information about the historical context of collecting and description at Wilson Special Collections Library.

> Comment: We are at the beginning of a long-term project to consciously edit all of these finding aids, including centering documentation of enslaved people in the abstract. Researchers and Library staff are encouraged to contact us ([wilsonlibrary@unc.edu](mailto:wilsonlibrary@unc.edu)) to suggest finding aids in need of revision.

### Content warnings

We asked about the importance of content warnings to prepare researchers for the trauma they might encounter. Ashley Adams liked the idea of content warnings giving people the power to decide if and when they want to see something hurtful. She said that "seasoned" researchers expect to see it, but that doesn't mean there isn't a moment of shock or disgust. Kathy Atwater similarly said we should preserve the history, but let people make an informed choice about seeing it. The interviewees, however, were adamant that information, the truth, should never be hidden or obscured. Shelley Murphy said, “You got information on my family and my ancestors and all I'm asking for you to do is share it.” Ellen Fernandez-Sacco said “I don't need a gatekeeper. I just need a little flag.”

Several of the interviewees urged caution around the use of “harmful” in how we talk about the collections. Renate Yarborough Sanders pointed out that her history can be disturbing, but never harmful: “Harmful rubs me the wrong way.” Ashley Adams echoed that content can be hurtful and jarring, but not harmful. 

Olivia Dorsey Peacock and Khadija McNair urged us not to shy away from showing controversial material, such as bills of sale for enslaved people, but to contextualize it, let people know they are going to see this kind of record and what it documents.

Ashley Adams encouraged us to actively remind people to take time to be good to themselves, to process the violence they are seeing. 

> Comment: The language of our banner is being vetted multiple times by different interest groups in the Library.

> Comment: Our colleague Sarah Carrier in Research and Instruction has a practice of setting aside time during instruction sessions with undergraduates to talk about the significance, power, and seriousness of records of enslavement. Tech Services will learn more about this practice and periodically check in to find out if and how it can inform our description work.

### Language remediation

With some of the interviewees the conversation turned to remediation of biased and exclusionary language of finding aids. We asked in particular about the excessive description of white families. We heard from several of our interviewees that while it is frustrating to see Black people as an afterthought, at the same time knowing as much as possible about the white family relationship network can provide very important leads to discovery of information about African American ancestors. Balance the description of Black and white actors wherever possible, said Khadija McNair. There was support for remediation of description that venerates white family members for their wealth and political and social influence, especially when euphemistic language obscures that they were enslavers and it was the enslaved labor, knowledge, and skills that built that wealth. Bernetiae Reed, Olivia Dorsey Peacock, and Nicka Sewell-Smith urged us to bring the humanity to enslaved people by naming individuals in the finding aid. At the same time Nicka underscored the inhumanity of “planter” and suggested replacing that word with “slaveowner” or “slaveholder.” Renate Yarborough Sanders leant her support to this replacement too.

Carmen White told us that it’s not the finding aid language so much as the collection materials that are the most offensive, and “it's not the actual words [in the original records] it's the disregard of people that really bothers me….it's really just the disregard and the way that they really view human beings as property that gets me more than like actual verbiage… it's just the attitudes that you know that show up and the assumptions that people were making back then, and just complete dehumanization and disregard is what I find to be really problematic.”

Renate Yarborough Sanders, a regular researcher at Wilson Library, told us that she wasn’t focused on remediated finding aids as essential, but she had recently used one of our consciously edited finding aids and that she noticed and appreciated the changes that centered enslaved people. She previously worked with an earlier version that highlighted the institution of slavery as something to study, but failed to recognize the humanity of enslaved people who were documented.[^8] We were thrilled to get the feedback that the remediation work is noticeable.

> Comment: A sampling of language changes we are implementing in the finding aids:

- **planter-->enslaver**
- **slaves-->enslaved people**
- **slaveowner-->enslaver**
- **slave traders-->traffickers in enslaved people**
- **hiring out-->couple this expression with trafficking**
- **enslaved labor-->expand this to enslaved knowledge, skill, and labor**
- **“experienced slavery”**
- **“asserted freedom”**
- **runaway slaves, work slowdowns-->express as acts of resistance, self-emancipation by running away**
- **remove venerative language but not the networks of people**
- **remove academic, non-inclusive language**
- **entice the reader by centering information about enslaved people in the folder, series, collection**

### 50 year audits

Nicka Sewell-Smith suggested a 50 year audit of building names. Do these names still deserve to be on a building? Do the actions of the honoree still hold up over time?

> Comment: This work is in the purview of The University Commission on History, Race, and a Way Forward, which was formed in 2019. Their charge is “to explore, engage and teach the University’s history with race, and provide recommendations to the Chancellor on how we as a University community must reckon with the past.” Since 2019, the commission has recommended six names be removed from campus buildings because of their links to white supremacy.

## Conclusions

We began this project in hopes of gaining some insights into the perspectives and needs of researchers of African American family history. We have come away with a better understanding of what impact our descriptive work has on their research experience. We also have some ideas for where to channel our resources as we continue our reckoning work in Technical Services. Some of our key takeaways from our conversations include:

- **Expertise: genealogists have so much working knowledge about how to research in public records on location or online, and/or they have access to genealogist communities that can help. Special Collections archivists and librarians should not try to reinvent that wheel. We can be most helpful by focusing on the lane that we know: making records of enslavement more discoverable and accessible in personal and family archival collections in our repositories.**
- **Generosity of spirit: there is a willingness to help guide the way for less experienced researchers and to recruit the next generation of researchers of African American family history. We can be partners in that work by creating specialized guides that share the search tips we have for finding records of enslavement in this repository.**
- **Expectations: genealogists expect that their research will be painstaking, it will require persistence, and that a close reading of a lot of records is inevitable. We can help by getting them to the collections with good abstracts and catalog records, and then by adding folder level metadata to help target their research.**
- **Digitization: the more we can digitize the better. Genealogists are not asking us to transcribe the digitized materials (although they wouldn’t mind if we did); making more of it available is a higher priority than transcribing a small amount of it.**
- **Database: anything we create should feed to something bigger.**
- **Language remediation: this may not be the most important work we do for the genealogist audience, but it has the potential to impact how they experience their research. Ultimately this may be a more important consideration for our undergraduate audience.**
- **Perfect is the enemy of good: we do not need to completely solve the problem of biased, inadequate, non-inclusive description before we can begin to make improvements. We can start by scoping smaller projects that have achievable outcomes and will have a positive impact on researchers.**
- **Iteration: we are learning as we go and we expect that our descriptive practices and language will evolve as we revisit more legacy finding aids.**

## Background

The Technical Services Department of Wilson Special Collections Library previously conducted interviews with 10 researchers engaged in African American family history and genealogy research. The interviewees generously shared with the project team about their research processes and experiences. A summary of their feedback is available in the IDEA Grant Final Report. 
Some of the interviewees’ suggestions concerned communicating out about the work we are doing and creating a welcoming environment for questions and comments from the genealogical audience, who may feel less comfortable in the context of a special collections library at a large university. For Phase 2 of our IDEA work, we asked for feedback on clarity, tone, and placement of several statements that were composed to share information with researchers about our slavery era collection finding aids and how to communicate with library staff:

-	Initial statement in Processing Information that alerts researchers that this is a slavery era collection.
-	“Learn more here” statement that provides historical context of description for slavery era collections at Wilson Library and what we are doing to remediate and repair past descriptive practices.
-	Conscious editing statement in Processing Information that explains what sections of the finding aid have been remediated.
-	Reparative description statement in Processing Information that alerts researchers if additional information about enslaved people has been surfaced in that finding aid and how to find it.
-	Contact link at top of finding aid.
-	Contact us statement in Processing Information.

The finding aid for the [Leak and Wall Family Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/01468/) served as an example of these statements in context.

## The Interviews

### Legacy Description of Slavery Era Finding Aids: Initial statement

> This collection contains materials that document people claimed as property and reflect the violence and dehumanization of slavery in the U.S. South. Learn more here about how we are revising legacy description for slavery era collections at Wilson Special Collections Library.
  
This initial statement identifies a collection as part of a group of approximately 700 slavery era collections. The main feedback is that placing it within the Processing Information section may bury the lead. Antonio Austin suggested a banner not unlike the current yellow banner that we have to alert people to the Wilson Library infrastructure project. This is an intriguing idea but we will hold on any implementation until after we complete the ArchivesSpace finding aid migration project. At that point we will have a better idea of how prominently (or not) Processing Information will appear in the new non-linear finding aid display.

Tangentially, Antonio suggested a separate webpage that would be a comprehensive list of the 700 collections. Being able to browse a list of collection names could be of immense value to genealogists who are engaged with multiple family name searching. This also is an intriguing idea and one that we hopefully will be able to implement post-migration. In the meantime we will consult with colleagues to determine if there are short term solutions for sharing that information with researchers.

> Wilson Library holds more than 500 collections that document people claimed as property and reflect the violence and dehumanization of slavery in the U.S. South. These materials date from the early 1700s to the late 1800s following emancipation and include bills of sale of enslaved people; receipts that document the hiring out of labor of enslaved people; lists of enslaved people maintained by their enslavers; plantation journals and account books that document the labor, skills, and knowledge of enslaved people and their participation in the local economies; letters written about and sometimes by enslaved people; and legal documents, such as wills that document the trafficking of enslaved people across generations of families.
  
>  Beginning in 1930, UNC history professor J. G. de Roulhac Hamilton, motivated by his vision to create a repository for the preservation and study of the history of the U.S. South, began a concerted effort to collect materials chiefly from politically and socially influential white families in this region. Hamilton’s Southern Historical Collection, which today is part of the Wilson Special Collections Library, was intended to perpetuate a white supremist narrative of history.
Librarians and archivists who wrote the initial descriptions of these collections, which were often an inventory of itemized documents, focused entirely on the lived experiences of white people and did not consider the lives of enslaved people. In the 1980s and 1990s, new finding aids were written that identified the institution of slavery as a subject for scholarly research, but still failed to center individuals who were not white. Euphemistic and non-inclusive language, a style that privileged academic researchers over all others seeking access to materials about enslaved people, is used throughout these finding aids.

>  Our past practices are problematic, and we are working to repair them by rectifying language that upholds white supremacy and by highlighting materials created by and about enslaved people. Older versions of revised finding aids will be available to researchers.
  
>  For more information about plans and milestones for this work, please see information about our remediation projects and our guidelines for finding aid remediation below. We welcome thoughts, suggestions, and questions at wilsonlibrary@unc.edu.

The intention of this “Learn more” statement is to be transparent about the history of description and to inform researchers about how we are engaging with that description in the present. We received positive feedback from all three interviewees and some additional suggestions for improving the statement. Olivia Dorsey Peacock made several key points: 1) be inclusive of more formats in that first paragraph. We hit the highlights, but some researchers may also read this statement as a guide to what formats are available. 2) In the second and third paragraphs, emphasize the impact of Hamilton’s white supremacist collecting: enslaved people were silenced again in the twentieth century, and the downplaying of the impact of slavery has brought us to this work we are doing now. 3) In the fourth paragraph, make clear that older versions of the finding aid will be available because they are a part of this history too. Olivia raised other important questions about J. G. de Rhoulac Hamilton and his relationships with the original families who donated their papers. To some extent these are addressed in one of the additional resources links at the end of the statement. TS Archival may want to consider adding a descriptive blurb to the link about the history of Hamilton’s collecting.

### Conscious Editing and Reparative Description for this Collection

> 	Conscious Editing Work by: [name, date] (Updated abstract, subject headings, scope and content note, historical note, and contents list). Earlier versions of the finding aid are available upon request.

> 	In [YEAR], archivists reviewed this [collection/series/folder] to uncover more information about the lives of enslaved and free Black people. Containers that include materials related to enslaved and free Black people during the antebellum period, the institution of slavery, or freed people after the Civil War are indicated as "Records of enslavement" or "Records of Reconstruction." Researchers are advised that the collection may include more documentation of slavery than has been identified in this finding aid.

With these two statements we want to let researchers know what we’ve been editing and why. With the second statement, we especially want them to know that our work may not be comprehensive. Having previously interviewed family history researchers we know that people looking for enslaved ancestors use finding aids as guides and starting points. Persistence and creative thinking beyond the finding aid are where the breakthroughs happen. The interviewees seem to think these statements were sufficient. If researchers need or want more clarification around the edits, they will ask. 
Renate Yarborough Sanders suggested we update “free Black people” to “free people of color” and “Records of enslavement” to “Records of enslavement and free people of color” to be more inclusive. 

Olivia Dorsey Peacock suggested that we consider providing links to and contextual information about earlier versions of the finding aid. In some cases, a paper-based legacy finding aid has become part of a collection and it is filed in the first folder. We also previously, albeit briefly, explored the idea of scanning paper-based legacy finding aids and providing a link to the digitized version in the current finding aid. We see value in this practice, but have not yet incorporated it into our remediation workflow due to lack of resolution on where to store the digital files. Born digital legacy finding aids are findable in the Internet Archive, but we have not offered that explanation directly to our researchers.

### Questions and Comments for the Library

> Contact button on the banner
 
> 	We welcome questions and comments at wilsonlibrary@unc.edu
  
We want to communicate openness to questions and feedback alike, especially around reparative description. We wondered if the “contact” button in the banner was visible and encouraging enough. The feedback on this seemed to suggest that having both the button at the top (Antonio Austin asked if it could float along the side of the finding aid?) and the additional statement in the Processing Information section would be fine. The email address that is provided should be a link, and it should take the researcher to the same form as the contact button. Renate Yarborough Saunders suggested that it would be helpful if that contact button opened in a new tab in order to facilitate a researcher formulating their request by going back and forth between the finding aid and the contact us form. We have investigated this and it is possible, but it may be a project that waits until after the migration to ArchivesSpace, when global edits like this one will be much easier to execute.

### Other Suggestions

We knew we would get thoughtful feedback on the statements and we hoped for additional discussion on related topics of interest to our interviewees. We were not disappointed. Below are the highlights of the tangents we went on with the interviewees:

- Silos

Antonio Austin encouraged us to get beyond siloed information about enslaved people, to think about how we can make a bigger impact on the genealogical research community: silos minimize the impact of our efforts to “reclaim voices that have been silenced.” He mentioned Family Search as a place where we could share out our finding aids and/or digitized materials so that more eyes would find these records. We will delve deeper into Family Search to see what this could look like. 

- Provenance
  
Antonio also indirectly encouraged us not to over-prioritize our concerns about provenance: keep the focus on maximum impact. We began remediation work on our 700 slavery era collections during the pandemic, when our library was closed and we did not have access to collections unless they were digitized. At that time our strategy was to do what we could, where we could: repair language and reframe the description to recognize the humanity of the enslaved people in these collections, instead of just seeing slavery as an institution to be studied by scholars. We wondered, though, if we should be addressing provenance that placed enslavers at the center of the historical record. Is description remediation enough, or should we be re-processing these collections? Once we had regular access to the collections again, our strategy evolved to repairing language and surfacing more information about individual enslaved people and the institution of slavery. Rather than tackle a massive provenance reprocessing project, we decided to use the available resources to continue to chip away at the 700 with remediation and repair. Reconsideration of provenance and reprocessing is not off the table, but for the time being we are keeping our focus on remediation and repair in order to get to as many collections as we can.

- Public presentations
  
Antonio also encouraged us to get out there and present on our work in public spaces so that more people know what kind of work we are doing to improve access to slavery era collections for genealogical researchers: do not continue to hide the people who finally have been unhidden. He also cautioned us that there might be pushback from some audiences who feel strongly about who should and should not do this remediation work. We hear that and we are committed to thinking carefully about what our roles are as a predominantly white institution (PWI) and as individuals who are people of color and white should be in this work. This is an ongoing conversation we will have with ourselves as we navigate accountability, the needs of our researchers, and the potentially fraught outcomes of good intentions.

- Subject headings
  
Renate Yarborough Sanders helped us better understand her research needs when she pointed out that she is not able to build a dataset of enslavers for a given county. She appreciated statements of fact in the abstract ([name] was an enslaver and…) and that we have subject headings for slavery and for plantation owners, but how would she build a comprehensive list of people who enslaved anywhere from one to hundreds of people? In following up on this question with colleagues, we discovered that “slaveholder” is already a Library of Congress subject heading, as is “enslaver.” We wondered why our institution has used “slaveholder” only eight times for nearly 700 slavery era collections. We investigated “enslaver” as well, thinking that would be a more current term, and found that Library of Congress directs that “enslavers is not an appropriate term for those who owned slaves; instead, it should be used for any individuals or groups involved in slavery and the slave trade, including those who captured people, ship captains and crew who transported them, auctioneers who ran slave markets, merchants who purchased and sold slaves, plantation overseers and managers, banks and firms that financed plantations, institutions and individuals who owned slaves, etc.”([https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh2022006245.html]( https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh2022006245.html)). We will continue the conversation around these terms with our colleagues to decide the best way forward to solve this research problem.

### Conclusions and Next Steps

As always, we are deeply appreciative of our interviewees and their generous sharing of insights, experiences, and suggestions. The ten interviews we conducted in Phase 1 and the three in Phase 2 have been important reminders of the value of listening to researchers talk about their experiences and understand where the gaps are from their perspectives. Even when we are on the right track, we can miss things—like an important subject heading—that are crucial components of productive interactions between researchers and our collections.

Going forward we will be following up on a few items mentioned above and consolidated here:

Action items:

-	Browsable list of 700 slavery era collections on a webpage: proceed with discussion with colleagues about how to share this information with researchers.
-	Edit the “Learn more here” statement to underscore long term impact of collecting driven by white supremacy.
-	Article link about Wilson’s collecting at the bottom of the “Learn more here” statement: reread article and add a descriptive blurb.
-	Edit statement about reparative description in Processing Information and “Records of enslavement” in Contents List to include free people of color.
-	Slaveholders and/or Enslavers subject headings: discuss and decide which headings to use.

Conversations we can start having in Wilson:

-	Legacy finding aids: establish a policy and/or workflow for making legacy finding aids (paper-based and born digital) accessible from the current finding aid. 
-	Family Search: how would this interact with On These Grounds?
-	Conversations around this work at a PWI
-	Public presentations: what are some new venues for getting the word out about new approaches to description for slavery era collections at Wilson Library?

After migration of finding aids to ArchivesSpace:

-	Banner to identify slavery era collection finding aids: initiate discussion with colleagues about possible implementation.
-	Contact button: can it open in a new tab? Can it float along side of the finding aid? Initiate discussion with colleagues about implementation.
-	Email address in the Processing Information: can it point to the contact form? Initiate discussion with colleagues about implementation.
