- **[Duplicating Technologies Collection, 1782-2018](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/70169/)
This collection is composed of culturally significant documents that were copied or printed using different duplicating technologies from 1782 through 2018. Together, these documents trace the development of home and office printing, from Watt's Copy Machine to the Xerox. The copying and printing processes applied by the duplicating technologies chronicled in this collection utilized either pressure or light sensitivity and were largely reliant on new chemical developments to achieve the results collected here. Through this collection, it is possible to see how printing and copying technologies referenced and built on previous processes, improving on previous methods and connecting these technologies through time.**
