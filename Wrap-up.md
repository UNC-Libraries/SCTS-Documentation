# Workflow

**1.** Processor fills out blue sheet through TS ticketing form. 

**2.** Branch is merged and pushed to make changes live, ticket is sorted into "blue sheets" section of TS gmail. (Changes will take 1-2 hours to show live after branch is pushed). 

**3.** Check to make sure changes are live by searching online finding aid for the new acc number(s). Delete branch from sourcetree. 

**4.** Update ASpace, ProcRec, and New on the Web spreadsheet. 

**5.** Create/edit MARC.

# Sourcetree 

Check live version of finding aid to see if it's updated correctly. If so, delete the relevant branch from your local branches on Sourcetree, then from the remote branches (right click branch, "delete [branch]"). 

Note: If you make a mistake, and someone was still working on this branch, they should still be able to repopulate to remote by "pushing" their local branch.

# Proc-Rec

ProcRec Table in processing_database.mdb 

The Proc_Rec table in the access database processing_database.mdb tracks the majority of our processing statistics: 

This access database is found here: G:\wilson\TS\archival\mss_and_archives\processors\processing_database 

The fields are as follows: 

- **ProcNum**: auto-generated by the table
- **UARS, SHC, SFC, NCC, GM**: Repository
- **CollNum**: Collection number*
- **AccNum**: Accession number
- **New or Addition**
- **Leader**: Lead processor
- **Startdate**: Start of processing
- **Finishdate**: Date entered into ProcRec
- **NumItem**: Number of items
- **LinearFeet**
- **Components of Description**: Descriptive components, typically the number of containers added
- **Born digital items**
- **A/V items**
- **Graphic items**
- **Estimated hours spent**
- **Code**: I (intake processing), UD (user-driven), E (enhanced processing), LP (List2Proc), IP (Ifrastructure preparation)
- **Comments**

*No leading zeros, no letters. Collections starting with "P" use "9" in place of the P. "NCC" = "7". "HC" = "8".

A new table needs to be created at the start of every fiscal year. Easiest way to do this is by creating a copy of last year's table and renaming.


# ASpace

In addition to Proc_Rec, we also update the ArchivesSpace accession record with basic processing information. 

### Collection Management

Under "Collection Management" in the accession record in ASpace, update the "Processors" field with the processor's name, and the "processing status" field with the level of processing completed.

Save changes.

### Create Event

At the top right of the accession record, click "add event" and select type "processed" for fully processed accessions or "processed [AV/photographs/mixed materials/etc.]" for partially processed accessions. Click "add event"

Note: Dawne can set up event templates that automatically populates the information needed when a processing event is created.

Save event.
