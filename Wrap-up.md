## Workflow

**1.** Processor fills out blue sheet and gives to Laura Smith 

**2.** Branch is merged and pushed to make changes live, puts sheets in the "wrap up" pile. (Changes will take 1-2 hours to show live after pushes the branch). 

**3.** Check to make sure changes are live by searching page for the new acc number(s). Delete branch from sourcetree. 

**4.** Update AT and ProcRec. 

**5.** Create/edit MARC. 


# Proc-Rec

ProcRec Table in processing_database.mdb 

The Proc_Rec table in the access database processing_database.mdb tracks the majority of our processing statistics: 

This access database is found here: G:\wilson\TS\archival\mss_and_archives\processors\processing_database 

The fields are as follows: 

- **ProcNum**: auto-generated by the table
- **UARS, SHC, SFC, NCC, GM**: Repository
- **CollNum**: Collection number*
- **AccNum**: Accession number
- **New or Addition**
- **Leader**: Lead processor
- **Startdate**: Start of processing
- **Finishdate**: Date entered into ProcRec
- **NumItem**: Number of items
- **LinearFeet**
- **Components of Description**: Descriptive components, typically the number of containers added
- **Born digital items**
- **A/V items**
- **Graphic items**
- **Estimated hours spent**
- **Code**: R (regular stream), UD (user-driven), WD (Wilson driven), AP (Acc2Proc)
- **Comments**

*No leading zeros, no letters. Collections starting with "P" use "9" in place of the P. "NCC" = "7". "HC" = "8".

Control table in the processing database ideally contains a master list of all finding aids. Updated whenever I receive a blue sheet for a new collection. 


# AT

In addition to Proc_Rec, we also update the Archivist Toolkit accession record with very basic processing information. Fields that need updating are found under the following two tabs in an AT Accession Record: Basic Information and Acknowledgments, Restrictions, and Processing Tasks. 

### Basic Information Tab

Replace the accessions shelf locations in the General Accession Note field with the phrase "Reg Order" (leave UID for digital)

Acknowledgments, Restrictions, and Processing Tasks Tab 

- Change Processing Status to Processed  
- Check the Processed check box (yes, a little redundant)  
- Add the Processed Date. I have been using the date that I am filling in the information here, not the date that actual processing was finished.
