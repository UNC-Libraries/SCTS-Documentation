# 1. Introduction

If you process manuscript collections and archival record groups at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, this manual is for you. In these pages, you will find discussions of many of the issues you will
face during processing. We think this manual answers a number of questions quite well, yet, because of
the unique nature of archival materials, there will be many other issues that will arise as you work with a
collection. This manual will not replace conversation and consultation with your supervising archivist.
Please, be guided by the following:

**NEVER HESITATE TO ASK QUESTIONS!!!**

None of the information contained in this manual is writ in stone, although some procedures are firmer
than others. All procedures are grounded in widely accepted archival standards. Some of these
standards, however, are either open to interpretation or not tremendously specific in terms of
implementation. Should major changes occur, you will be notified. Please remember that you are always
encouraged to make suggestions aimed at improving procedures or this manual itself.

## Who We Are

SCTS-Archival processes collection for all five of the Wilson Special Collection Library's collecting units: 

**<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/shc/">SOUTHERN HISTORICAL COLLECTION (SHC).</a>** The University began acquiring North Carolina
manuscripts in the 1840s, broadened its policies in the 1920s to seek manuscripts from the
entire South, and established the SHC in 1930. The SHC is a center for research on the South,
with important holdings from all of the southern states. Manuscript collections are private
papers of individuals and families or records of private organizations or institutions. The SHC
preserves letters, diaries, account books, unpublished writings, photographs, audio and
videotapes, and other materials. As a general rule, the SHC does not retain collections of museum items
or of published works. Researchers who use the SHC's materials include historians and history
graduate students from universities all over the world, scholars from a wide variety of other
disciplines, family and local historians, and others.

**<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/sfc/">SOUTHERN FOLKLIFE COLLECTION (SFC).</a>** The SFC became a collecting unit in
1986. One of the nation’s foremost archival resources for the study of American folk music and popular culture, SFC holdings extensively document all forms of southern musical and oral traditions across the entire spectrum of individual and community expressive arts, as well as mainstream media production. SFC materials are in many formats, including commercial audiodiscs,
tapes, and compact discs; field tapes and instant audiodiscs; photographs; films; and videotapes.

**<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/uarms/">UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES (UA or UARMS).</a>** UA is the official repository for the historically valuable,
unpublished records of both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and the
major administrative offices of the UNC System. Records date from the chartering of the
university in 1789 to the present and include minute books of the Board of Trustees;
correspondence of chancellors, presidents, provosts, and deans; minutes of faculty meetings;
files of academic and administrative departments; reports of faculty committees; and records of
faculty and student organizations. University departments began sending records to The Wilson
Library in the 1940s, originally to the Southern Historical Collection and then to the Manuscripts
Department. In 1978, Chancellor Ferebee Taylor officially recognized University Archives and
Records Service as the archival repository for the campus.

**<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/rbc/">RARE BOOK COLLECTION (RBC)</a>.** Although the RBC is primarily...well...a rare book collection, it also includes more than 100 manuscript collections. RBC collections consist of literary and other
manuscripts not relating to the South, as well as collections documenting the history of printing. Among the holdings are materials relating to George
Bernard Shaw, John Ruskin, and other British and American writers of note. Also included are
the records of J. M. Dent & Sons, a major British publishing house, and A. P. Watt & Company,
the first literary agent firm; Latino and Mexican comic book collections; a collecting of printing blocks from the Propaganda Fide Press;  Most of the manuscript collections formerly housed at UNC's Health Sciences Library also belong to the RBC.

**<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/ncc/">NORTH CAROLINA COLLECTION.</a>** Like the RBC, the NCC primarily holds published items; however, it also includes more than 30 manuscript collections, many of which pertain to the author Thomas Wolfe.

## What We Do

Archivists are intermediaries between the creators of collections and the present and future users of
those collections. Archivists are charged by society with deciding which portions of the enormous
quantity of papers and records become part of the permanent historical record of our culture. Our task
is to preserve these materials and to make them accessible to researchers who study and tell the stories
of our past. The raw materials of history enter the Special Collections Technical Services (TS) department
in various states of disarray and exit in a more usable form. TS renders materials usable by subjecting
them to "processing": arranging a collection in some logical way; describing the collection’s
arrangement, contents, and research potential so that researchers and staff can find the specific
materials they need; cataloging the collection to provide access points that lead researchers to the
materials they seek; and taking physical preservation measures to ensure that materials survive long
into the future.

A good deal of processing is cerebral--developing an arrangement scheme, writing the description,
selecting access points--but it also entails work that is mundane and most decidedly unglamorous. Tasks
like unfolding, flattening, removing paper clips, annotating, separating, and refoldering are very
common in processing work. As in many other fields, countless hours of behind-the-scenes work go into
making the writing (and reading) of history look easy. From time to time, nearly every one of us in
processing work experiences moments of despair when the amount and detail of work threatens to
overwhelm. When this happens, it may be helpful to remember that the papers we process will soon
become the "stuff" of history. Each one of us is a link in the long chain of knowledge that stretches from
the lives of the men and women who created the materials to the eventual users of the archives ... and,
lest we forget, on to all those generations who will benefit from the insights gained by those users now
and still to come.
