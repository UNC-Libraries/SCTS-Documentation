# 1. Introduction

If you process manuscript collections and archival record groups at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, this manual is for you. How to Proceed was written to be used. It was designed to serve both as a training manual for new staff
and as a reference tool for seasoned hands. Novices are encouraged to read the manual through and to
consult it frequently as they struggle to whip their first few collections into shape. Old-timers may
benefit from periodic review of procedures, but will most often find the manual useful as a ready
reference source.

In these pages, you will find discussions of many of the issues you will
face during processing. We think this manual answers a number of questions quite well, yet, because of
the unique nature of archival materials, there will be many other issues that will arise as you work with a
collection. This manual will not replace conversation and consultation with your supervising archivist.
Please, be guided by the following:

**NEVER HESITATE TO ASK QUESTIONS!!!**

None of the information contained in this manual is writ in stone, although some procedures are firmer
than others. All procedures are grounded in widely accepted archival standards. Some of these
standards, however, are either open to interpretation or not tremendously specific in terms of
implementation. Should major changes occur, you will be notified. Please remember that you are always
encouraged to make suggestions aimed at improving procedures or this manual itself.

## Who We Are

SCTS-Archival processes collections for all five of the Wilson Special Collection Library's collecting units: 

 - **<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/shc/">SOUTHERN HISTORICAL COLLECTION (SHC).</a>** The University began acquiring North Carolina
manuscripts in the 1840s, broadened its policies in the 1920s to seek manuscripts from the
entire South, and established the SHC in 1930. The SHC is a center for research on the South,
with important holdings from all of the southern states. Manuscript collections are private
papers of individuals and families or records of private organizations or institutions. The SHC
preserves letters, diaries, account books, unpublished writings, photographs, audio and
videotapes, and other materials. As a general rule, the SHC does not retain collections of museum items
or of published works. Researchers who use the SHC's materials include historians and history
graduate students from universities all over the world, scholars from a wide variety of other
disciplines, family and local historians, and others.

 - **<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/sfc/">SOUTHERN FOLKLIFE COLLECTION (SFC).</a>** The SFC became a collecting unit in 1986. One of the nation’s foremost archival resources for the study of American folk music and popular culture, SFC holdings extensively document all forms of southern musical and oral traditions across the entire spectrum of individual and community expressive arts, as well as mainstream media production. SFC materials are in many formats, including commercial audiodiscs,
tapes, and compact discs; field tapes and instant audiodiscs; photographs; films; and videotapes.

 - **<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/uarms/">UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES (UA or UARMS).</a>** UA is the official repository for the historically valuable,
unpublished records of both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and the
major administrative offices of the UNC System. Records date from the chartering of the
university in 1789 to the present and include minute books of the Board of Trustees;
correspondence of chancellors, presidents, provosts, and deans; minutes of faculty meetings;
files of academic and administrative departments; reports of faculty committees; and records of
faculty and student organizations. University departments began sending records to The Wilson
Library in the 1940s, originally to the Southern Historical Collection and then to the Manuscripts
Department. In 1978, Chancellor Ferebee Taylor officially recognized University Archives and
Records Service as the archival repository for the campus.

 - **<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/rbc/">RARE BOOK COLLECTION (RBC)</a>.** Although the RBC is primarily...well...a rare book collection, it also includes more than 100 manuscript collections. RBC collections consist of literary and other
manuscripts not relating to the South, as well as collections documenting the history of printing. Among the holdings are materials relating to George
Bernard Shaw, John Ruskin, and other British and American writers of note. Also included are
the records of J. M. Dent & Sons, a major British publishing house, and A. P. Watt & Company,
the first literary agent firm; Latino and Mexican comic book collections; a collecting of printing blocks from the Propaganda Fide Press;  Most of the manuscript collections formerly housed at UNC's Health Sciences Library also belong to the RBC.

 - **<a href="https://library.unc.edu/wilson/ncc/">NORTH CAROLINA COLLECTION.</a>** Like the RBC, the NCC primarily holds published items; however, it also includes more than 30 manuscript collections, many of which pertain to the author Thomas Wolfe.

## What We Do

Archivists are intermediaries between the creators of collections and the present and future users of
those collections. Archivists are charged by society with deciding which portions of the enormous
quantity of papers and records become part of the permanent historical record of our culture. Our task
is to preserve these materials and to make them accessible to researchers who study and tell the stories
of our past. The raw materials of history enter the Special Collections Technical Services (TS) department
in various states of disarray and exit in a more usable form. TS renders materials usable by subjecting
them to "processing": arranging a collection in some logical way; describing the collection’s
arrangement, contents, and research potential so that researchers and staff can find the specific
materials they need; cataloging the collection to provide access points that lead researchers to the
materials they seek; and taking physical preservation measures to ensure that materials survive long
into the future.

A good deal of processing is cerebral--developing an arrangement scheme, writing the description,
selecting access points--but it also entails work that is mundane and most decidedly unglamorous. Tasks
like unfolding, flattening, removing paper clips, annotating, separating, and refoldering are very
common in processing work. As in many other fields, countless hours of behind-the-scenes work go into
making the writing (and reading) of history look easy. From time to time, nearly every one of us in
processing work experiences moments of despair when the amount and detail of work threatens to
overwhelm. When this happens, it may be helpful to remember that the papers we process will soon
become the "stuff" of history. Each one of us is a link in the long chain of knowledge that stretches from
the lives of the men and women who created the materials to the eventual users of the archives ... and,
lest we forget, on to all those generations who will benefit from the insights gained by those users now
and still to come.

## Basic Premises

In accepting archival materials into The Wilson Special Collections Library, we are accepting the
responsibility for preserving the materials and making them accessible to researchers. Processing is
based on a few general premises:

 - Our work is an essential contribution to the collective memory of our culture and society.
Researchers who study and tell the stories of our past, fundamental to our sense of identity and
direction as individuals and communities, can do it well only if we do our jobs effectively.

 - Every collection should be made at least minimally accessible. A collection must have a written
description (finding aid) that gives researchers some indication of what they might find in the
collection, if not pointers to the boxes or folders in which to look for specific materials of
interest. Materials need not be housed in folders or arranged into a comprehensible order
before being used by a researcher, but in most cases they will be, and in all cases a processing
archivist will review an unprocessed collection before releasing it for researcher use.

 - There are no one-size-fits-all processing treatments. We consider each collection’s condition and
perceived research value carefully in determining our processing actions. A supervising archivist
will always be available to assist and guide you as you process collections in accordance with
these premises.

## Overview of Processing

Manuscript collections are wonderfully diverse.

The SOUTHERN HISTORICAL COLLECTION focuses on the South, but it contains information about nearly
every part of the world because southerners have visited or lived in nearly every part of the world.
Within the South there is great diversity--rich, poor, male, female, African American, Native American,
politicians, farmers, housewives, and many others are represented in our collections. Manuscript
collections may contain letters, diaries, ledgers, receipts, sound recordings, pictures, and materials in
other formats. They range in size from one item in one folder to thousands of items in hundreds of
boxes. Some arrive here in file folders, beautifully organized and labeled; others arrive loose in garbage
bags. Because of this variety, there can be few hard and fast rules for processing manuscript collections.
There are, however, standards, policies, and procedures that must be applied with common sense and
flexibility.

UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES (UA) includes records documenting every stage in the growth of the nation’s first
state university and its response to local and national issues, from slavery to evolution to freedom of
speech. These records are important not only to researchers specifically interested in the history of the
University of North Carolina but to those interested in any aspect of the history of higher education.
They are also important to current administrators at UNC-CH who need to consider past practices when
making decisions. Records are transferred to the UA in accordance with the University Archives and
Records Management Services General Records Retention and Disposition Schedule, which specifies
what records are archival and what records may be disposed once their retention period has ended.
Even so, records arrive in varying states of order and disorder. Some have been kept in logical file
systems, others have not. Some have been stored and forgotten for many years in attics and basements.
As with manuscript materials, the variety of archival records necessitates flexible and common sense
applications of standards, policies, and procedures.

Processing is typically thought of as arranging, describing, and cataloging. This manual divides processing
into a number of tasks: preliminary research and survey, planning, arrangement, description, and
preservation. While this manual contains instructions on producing abstracts that are used to write
catalog records, hard-core cataloging is not typically done by processors and so is not covered in this manual.

Not every processing project will proceed in the orderly sequence described in this manual. Some tasks
will be undertaken simultaneously or in a different order and not all tasks will be performed for every
collection. When deciding how much to do and in what order to do it, remember that your goal is to
preserve the materials and make them accessible in as timely a fashion as possible. And remember to
consult your supervising archivist for assistance. When you begin to process a collection, you will first
become familiar with the background of the creator of the materials, the history of the collection, and
the materials themselves. You will prepare a processing plan, which you will present to and discuss with
your supervising archivist. Your plan may be modified at this point to ensure that it conforms to our
usual practices and that the projected level of work is appropriate given the research potential and
condition of the collection and the time available for processing. This plan is a working document that
will be reviewed and revised as you process the collection.

You are now ready to implement your proposed plan. You will put the materials into the order agreed upon in your processing plan (with
necessary modifications, of course) and you will complete requisite preservation work. As you work
through the collection, you will take notes on everything, chiefly to record the information that you will
need when you write your finding aid. These notes will also serve to refresh your memory if you are
gone from your project for an extended period of time. They will also provide helpful tracks should
someone need to find materials in your absence or take over your project.

As you process, you will begin constructing the collection's finding aid. It is usually easier to describe the
materials as you go through them, rather than wait until you have everything arranged and then try to
remember what you saw days or weeks ago. In fact, you may write a draft of the biographical or
historical note as soon as you finish your background research and later add any essential information
gleaned during processing. Similarly, it is usually a good idea to write series descriptions as you go
through the collection and make needed revisions, if any, after you have gone through the whole
collection. You can do this directly in ArchivesSpace or in another format such as a Microsoft Word document. As you will see later in this manual, it is usually good practice to write your scope and content
note and abstract last.

When you have finished the draft of the finding aid in ArchivesSpace, your supervising archivist will review it. When
the two of you are satisfied with the draft, you will submit a <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/SCTS-Documentation/blob/main/Ticketing.md#blue-sheets-and-merge-requests">Blue Sheet request</a> for your finding aid to be published.
