# Original Order

The creator's/organization's original arrangement has been retained.

Folder titles were derived from original folder names and from descriptive metadata found within the files by the processing archivist.

Paper files have been rehoused as received, with some folder titles and subject groupings of loose materials, such as Awards and Certificates, created by the processing archivist.
