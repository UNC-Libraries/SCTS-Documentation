## Remediation projects

### Finding aids remediation: July through December 2022

Six month phase of ongoing project

* Completed the remediation of the finding aids listed on the [Popular Topics by Collection](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/researching-records-slavery/collections-popular-topics) page on the Studying Slavery in the Southern Historical Collection Lib Guide. Documented the practice and guidelines used for this remediation.
* Began remediating corresponding catalog records for remediated finding aids.  

* Identified, redescribed, and queued for digitization images of enslaved and/or formerly enslaved people in slavery-era collections. Example: [William Starr Meyers Images](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/P0094/)

* Drafted statement about historical finding aid practice and our remediation. Statement vetted by Ethical Description Working Group and Southern Historical Collection staff. 

* Drafted text of a banner to be included on finding aids for slavery era collections notifying researchers of  content and the bias in finding aid description. The text will be included in a finding aid note now and incorporated as a banner when we implement a new finding aids public interface system. 

* Piloted linking to legacy finding aids that have been scanned and turned into pdfs. Example: [Hubard Family Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00360/)

### Adding names of enslaved people to finding aids, November 2021-February 2022

* Added names of enslaved people to the description of [Benjamin Franklin Little Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03954/):
    - Biographical note
    - Scope and Content
    - Series 1A, 2 series descriptions
    - Folder 30
    
* Added names of enslaved people to the description of [Arnold and Screven Family Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03419/):
    - Biographical note
    - XOPF-3419/1
    
* Added names of enslaved and free people of color to the description for [Bullock and Hamilton Family Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00101/):
    - Biographical note
    - Folders 5, 6, 19, 22, 25, 29, 30, 39

        The biographical note and folder 19 include this note to acknowledge archivist intervention: NOTE: parenthetical information is derived from original document; the archivist has used more modern terms to describe the physical condition of Jordan, the age of Patience, and the occupations of Dick, Charity, Charlotte, Eily, and William.

* Added names of enslaved people to the description for these volumes in [Hentz Family Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00332/):

    -  Autobiography Parts I and II
    -  Obstetrical Record 

         Includes this explanatory note: patients who were enslaved typically are listed by first name only, followed by the name of the enslaver in the case list. In the index, the patients who were enslaved are typically listed with the last name of the enslaver. Processing archivists have employed the index version of the name to potentially enhance discovery. When we have misidentified a person's last name, please let us know at wilsonlibrary@unc.edu.

   -  Medical Journal
   
   
* Added names of enslaved people to the description of volumes and correspondence in [Clegg Family Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/05503/):
 
   -  Rock Springs Steam Saw Mill, circa 1866-1868

   -  Farm time book, circa 24 August 1873-1874
   -  Correspondence, 1865

### Antebellum finding aids: LibGuides project, summer and fall 2020 

* Focusing on finding aids highlighted in UNC Libraries LibGuides *Using Records about Slavery in the Southern Historical Collection* and *Voices of the Enslaved in Wilson Special Collections Library*.  

* Revised language in 30 small finding aids. Examples: [Isabella C Sourtan Letter](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00719/) and [Ben Sparkman Plantation Journal](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03574/) 

* Exploring approaches to remediation work on large and medium-sized collections of planation records and records about enslavement.  


### Antebellum finding aids: Pilot project, spring 2020 

* Revised 10 finding aids to experiment with how to conceptualize antebellum finding aid work 

* Rewrote abstracts centering enslaved communities 

* Included universal headings: Slavery--United States--History--19th century--Sources; Slavery--United States--History--18th century--Sources. 

* Revised headings for plantations, geographic names 

* Examples include: [Prudhomme Family](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00613/), [Quitman Family](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00616/), and [Pettigrew Family](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00592/) 


### Creating name authority records for names for enslaving families, spring and summer 2020 

* Headings created for approximately three hundred families 


### Revision of what was called the Tunstall Family Letter, fall 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from Research and Instructional Services, we reframed the finding aid to decenter the white male enslaver. 

* We renamed the collection the [Mary Tunstall Letter on Enslaved Child Betsy](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/05249) 

### Revising Maunsel White finding aid, summer 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from the SHC, we rewrote narrative description in the [Maunsel White Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/02234) that asserted in classic Lost Cause fashion that White was a "benevolent slave holder."  

* We also rewrote the abstract to center description on material related to enslaved people. 


### Revising J. Marion Sims finding aid, summer 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from Research and Instructional Services, we rewrote the abstract, scope/content note, and the biographical note in the [J. Marion Sims Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00666) that asserted that Sims who had conducted medical experiments on enslaved women was a “pioneer” in the field of gynecology.  

* We also analyzed the collection’s contents to see if there was any content about his experimentation on enslaved women. We did not find any, and we made that absence of information clear. “Sims also discussed the sale of enslaved persons, but the papers do not include any documentation of the experimental gynecological and cancer surgeries he conducted on enslaved women.” 

## Remediation guidelines
Remediation goal: To repair such that description is accessible, equitable, and helpful.

Shared definitions:
o	Accessible: the description does not assume insider knowledge, contexts are explained 
o	Equitable:  we will center what we know of the enslaved people as best we can.  
o	Helpful: sources about enslaved people are featured prominently 

Process for remediating an EAD finding aid
1.	Update <revision>: Updated for Conscious Editing of [all that apply: collection overview, subject headings, biographical note, scope and content, and contents list] by [Name].
2.	Update <processinfo>: Conscious Editing Work by: [Name], [month year]. Updated [collection overview, subject headings, biographical note, scope and content, and container list].
Add racial identity statement if it is not already there.
3.	Collection overview: this is a balancing act of centering what we know about Black people without misrepresenting the extent of the documentation available. In this phase of remediation we are decentering whiteness, but not eliminating existing description about the white family that is still useful. 
a.	Move biographical info from 545 tags to the 520; delete 545 tags. 
b.	Reduce/remove as much biographical information as possible. In family papers, individual names should be few if any (they can still appear in the subject headings). Remove venerative language (e.g., prosperous, prominent, planter) and edit as needed. If “prominence” should be conveyed, try “politically and socially influential,” or other language that speaks more directly to the power than “prominence.”
c.	Add racial identity to the white family.
d.	Acknowledge existence of enslaved people and their relationship to the white family that they are living alongside of in the first sentence.
    
i.	Jackson and Prince Family (https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00371/): The papers of Jackson, Prince, and Cobb families of Athens, Macon, and other locations in Georgia, and the Rootes family of Fredericksburg, Va., document the lives of white plantation owning families and the people enslaved by them on Halscot Plantation outside Athens, Ga.; Cookshay Plantation in Chambers County, Ala.; and other plantations in Bibb and Baker counties, Ga.
e.	Acknowledge plantation was based on enslaved labor.
i.	David Outlaw (https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/01534/): David Outlaw, a white farmer and a Whig member of Congress from 1847 to 1853, owned a farm near Windsor in Bertie County, N.C., whose operations included the forced labor of enslaved people. George, an enslaved person, managed the farm in David Outlaw's absence. 
f.	Acknowledge when Black people are the creators of the documentation and when they are represented from white people’s perspective (which is most often the case)
i.	Elliott and Gonzalez Family (https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/01009/): Enslaved people are represented in bills of sale and lists of enslaved people. There are also a few letters written by enslaved people and several more about them, especially their labor and acts of resistance to slavery, from the perspective of white family members.
g.	Recenter any available information about Black people to the first couple of sentences after the initial statement about who is documented in the collection.
i.	William Alexander Hoke (https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00345/) Topics include the buying and selling of enslaved people; human trafficking, then called "hiring out"; abolitionism; reminiscences about Julia, a nurse formerly enslaved by the family; Reconstruction era terrorism, including references to activities of the Ku Klux Klan; and Black membership at St. Luke's Church in Lincolnton, N.C. Other topics include
h.	Add plantation names that appear in container list, even if minor. 
i.	Add formats (deeds, indentures, wills, lists of enslaved people, estate papers, ledgers, whatever records document lives of enslaved people). 
i.	Mary Hunter Kennedy (https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03242/): Enslaved people are represented in bills of sale and work contracts that evidence human trafficking, and in the contested will of Christopher Houston (1737-1844), the anti-slavery patriarch who upon his death manumitted the people he enslaved. 
Collection overview questions: 
•	Is the first sentence about who is documented in the collection or what is documented?

####Subject headings
*	Add the universal: Slavery--United States--History--19th century—Sources and/or Slavery--United States—History—18th century--Sources
*	Add other format related headings
    - Slave bills of sale--[geographic location].
    - Enslaved persons--[geographic location]--Registers.
*	Add plantation names (see Plantation heading construction); do not crete a heading for anything that is really iffy to verify
*	Domestic terrorism—United States—History—19th century (for Reconstruction era violence


####Biographical note: For now, just do some basic editing.
*	Add racial identity.
*	Remove venerative language (e.g., planter, prominent, prosperous) and edit as needed.
*	Add slave schedule information, if available.
*	Add information about individual enslaved/Black people who are documented in the collection: Name, dates, locations, enslavers
    - George Hairston Papers (https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/01290/) Enslaved people documented in the collection include Elizabeth, a house servant, and her daughter by her enslaver Robert Hairston, probably in Lowndes County, Miss.; Frank, a child of 2 months who was sold from the estate of Absalom Powell in Columbus County, N.C., to Richard L. Byrne; Nancy, who attended to women enslaved by George Hairston and who herself was enslaved by Mary J. Cabaniss, probably in Pittsylvania County, Va.; and Roda, a girl enslaved by George Hairston (location unknown).

    Some genealogical research of people enslaved at Hairston family plantations has been done by descendent family members and is available at https://www.hairstonfamilygenealogy.com.

####Scope and Content: sometimes you will copy and paste the collection overview; often there is enhanced description that may be remediated. As in the collection overview, this is a careful balancing act of centering what we know about Black people without misrepresenting the extent of the documentation available. We also want to decenter whiteness, but not eliminate existing description that is still useful.

    Examples
    
*	Blackford Family Papers (https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/01912/): this collection has a lot of description about Black people, but too much for an easily readable paragraph. A list preserves all of the keywords for searching and makes it slightly easier to read. 
*	Springs Family Papers (https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/04121/): this one has heavy description at the file level. A list of topics by series provides key word access without replicating the heavier description applied to folder groupings (formerly subseries). 

####Contents list
*	Can the subseries be compressed to eliminate sub-sub-series? 
*	Add meaningful titles to all <unittitle> at the <c02>, <c03>, <c04> levels. Many antebellum finding aids have just dates at the subseries and folder levels. Add a format or other descriptor to the date.
*	Remediate language (see below #8).
    - Slaves, bills of sale for slaves, list of slaves-->enslaved people
    - Hiring out, buying and selling-->trafficking
    - Civil War-->American Civil War
*	Remove quotes that only add literary flourish or describe violence against Black people.
*	Remove repetition of biographical information about white people unless super helpful to understanding the rest of the scopenote.
*	Add item/folder level information for materials about Black people (if possible) 
*	Lists, wills, and bills of sale will often have names of enslaved people
*	 Overseer-plantation owner correspondence sometimes has names of enslaved people; description of the work performed by enslaved people, which may give some indication of occupation; descriptions of acts of resistance; and sometimes includes a characterization of conditions in the “neighborhood” (community) of the enslaved people. When describing acts of resistance by enslaved people, be thoughtful of what is essential to put in the finding aid and what can introduce bias.

    Example
*	324. Hayes Collection. (https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00324/ folder 582 scopenote): August 12: William S. Pettigrew described the circumstances in which Wilson, who worked in the house and was enslaved to Pettigrew at Magnolia, stole money from him and later confessed.

    Revise as

    August 12: William S. Pettigrew described the circumstances in which Wilson, who worked in the house and was enslaved to Pettigrew at Magnolia, allegedly stole money from him.

    Pettigrew’s letter says that Wilson confessed, but we should be skeptical of this report and we are not obligated to report everything Pettigrew says in the finding aid. We really don’t know if Wilson stole the money, if a confession was coerced, or even if a confession happened. This is a white enslaver writing to another white enslaver. The hook for (most?) researchers is not the confession, but the act of resistance. 

*	Make sure all content about Black people is represented at higher <c0n> levels.

    Examples

    *	Springs Family Papers (https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/04121/): this one has heavy description at the file level. Rather than replicate that heavy description at the collection scope and content, there is a list of topics by series.

####Language overview:
*	Remove dehumanizing and marginalizing language, Lost Cause mythology 
*	Slave-->enslaved 
*	Planter-->plantation owner
*	Slaveholder-->enslaver
*	Civil War-->American Civil War 
*	Free Blacks-->Free Black people 
*	Slave bills of sale-->bills of sale for people who were enslaved 
*	Plantation life-->note that it is plantation life for white people 
*	Supervising slaves-->overseeing the forced labor of enslaved people
*	Enslaved labor-->expand to enslaved labor, skills, and knowledge
*	Characterizing enslaved people of a plantation as a community where possible  
*	Trafficking-->can be used to describe hiring out and transfer of people claimed as property



####Helpful antebellum finding aids are accessible to a broad, general audience:
*	Describe sources about enslaved people near the listing of volumes and folders; coordinate description to page-able units  
*	Facilitate searching by geographic markers, genre types, source types, and topics.  
*	Describe the types of information that are available for researching Black family history  
*	Facilitate jumping in and out of the finding aid with a google keyword search; would not make understanding of the materials dependent on reading the finding aid linearly.  
*	Highlight materials about enslaved people but does not distort the density and accessibility of this data and how it shows up in a large bulky collection.   
*	Support genealogical research by providing information about the families represented.
*	Note correspondents beyond the other family members.   
*	Historicize and contextualize racist content   
*	Characterize the content i.e. say if the diaries and letters are descriptive and not routine  
*	Explain specialized information e.g. defining the terms manumission and indenture; explaining “race problem”; and defining source types like daybook
