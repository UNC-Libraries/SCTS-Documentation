## Antebellum finding aids: LibGuides project, summer and fall 2020 

* Focusing on finding aids highlighted in UNC Libraries LibGuides *Using Records about Slavery in the Southern Historical Collection* and *Voices of the Enslaved in Wilson Special Collections Library*.  

* Revised language in 30 small finding aids. Examples: [Isabella C Sourtan Letter](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00719/) and [Ben Sparkman Plantation Journal](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03574/) 

* Exploring approaches to remediation work on large and medium-sized collections of planation records and records about enslavement.  


## Antebellum finding aids: Pilot project, spring 2020 

* Revised 10 finding aids to experiment with how to conceptualize antebellum finding aid work 

* Rewrote abstracts centering enslaved communities 

* Included universal headings: Slavery--United States--History--19th century--Sources; Slavery--United States--History--18th century--Sources. 

* Revised headings for plantations, geographic names 

* Examples include: [Prudhomme Family](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00613/), [Quitman Family](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00616/), and [Pettigrew Family](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00592/) 


  

## Creating name authority records for names for enslaving families, spring and summer 2020 

* Headings created for approximately three hundred families 


## Revision of what was called the Tunstall Family Letter, fall 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from Research and Instructional Services, we reframed the finding aid to decenter the white male enslaver. 

* We renamed the collection the [Mary Tunstall Letter on Enslaved Child Betsy](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/05249) 

## Revising Maunsel White finding aid, summer 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from the SHC, we rewrote narrative description in the [Maunsel White Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/02234) that asserted in classic Lost Cause fashion that White was a "benevolent slave holder."  

* We also rewrote the abstract to center description on material related to enslaved people. 


  

## Revising J. Marion Sims finding aid, summer 2019 

* In response to a remediation request from Research and Instructional Services, we rewrote the abstract, scope/content note, and the biographical note in the [J. Marion Sims Papers](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/00666) that asserted that Sims who had conducted medical experiments on enslaved women was a “pioneer” in the field of gynecology.  

* We also analyzed the collection’s contents to see if there was any content about his experimentation on enslaved women. We did not find any, and we made that absence of information clear. “Sims also discussed the sale of enslaved persons, but the papers do not include any documentation of the experimental gynecological and cancer surgeries he conducted on enslaved women.”
