# Reference code
#### [DACS 2.1](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/1_reference_code)

This is a local unique identifier code. Typically, we use the collection number as this code.  

For Southern Folklife Collection, Southern Historical Collection, and University Archives collections, the code will consist of 5 numeric digits, e.g., 20460, 00517, or 40131. Z collections will have –z appended to the end of the code. 

North Carolina Collection codes will be alphanumeric and begin with ncc, and North Carolina Collection Photographic Archives collection codes will also be alphanumeric and begin with P, e.g., NCC0001 or P0081. 


# Title and date 
#### [DACS 2.3](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/3_title), [2.4](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/4_date)

The collection title contains the name of the collection creator, a collection title, and the collection’s inclusive dates. 

- **Name of collection creator:** The name of the collection creator may be a personal name, family name, organization name, or the name of a collector in the case of an intentionally assembled collection. Most often, you will use the authorized form of the name in the collection title, though there are occasional exceptions for certain personal names. The authorized form of a family name will appear in the creator entry but not in the title itself. 

- **Collection title:** The collection title is almost always “papers” for a collection composed of the papers of an individual or family. Use “records” for the records of organizations, University departments, or other corporate entities. A descriptive title is often used for intentionally assembled collections or smaller collections consisting of only one or two forms. Southern Folklife Collection collections are often given the title of “collection” at the discretion of the curator. 

- **Collection dates:** The collection’s inclusive dates, showing the earliest and latest dates of the materials, are included in the title. Dates do not have to be specific, especially at the collection level (e.g., 1940s-1970s). In some collections, you will find material from a range of years, but a large majority from a smaller range of years. For example, the Cyrus Aydlett Papers (#4907) contain material dating from 1941 through 1994, but most of the collection concerns Aydlett’s experiences during World War II and dates from 1943 through 1945. Thus, the inclusive dates of this collection are 1941-1994 and the bulk dates are 1943-1945: Cyrus Aydlett Papers, 1941-1994 (bulk 1943-1945). Occasionally a collection has a few items with dates significantly outside the range of the majority of the items. In this case the outlying date(s) may be appended to the range. For example, a collection with materials dated 1793 through 1822, but with a few items from 1988, would be listed: 1723-1822, 1988. The date of an alternate form of an item is the date the alternate form was created, not the date of the original item.  

Sample collection titles include: 

- John Messina Collection on the Charles Evers Mississippi Gubernatorial Campaign of 1971 

- Kemp Battle Nye Papers, 1930s-2000s 

- Craig, Ferris, and Flowers Family Papers, 1841-2014 

- Charles Maurice Redfern Papers, 1943-2002 (bulk 1943-1945) 

- Eastern Kentucky African American Migration Project Collection, 1927-2015 

- Order of the Golden Fleece of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Records, 1904-2019 

- Phillip G. Collins Collection on Ruey “Curley” Collins, circa 1920s-2009 


# Creator
#### [DACS 2.6](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/6_name_of_creators)

The creator element consists of the authorized form of the creator’s name. This may be a personal name, family name, or a name of a corporate body. Consulting the [Library of Congress Name Authority File](https://authorities.loc.gov/) is a good place to start to see if an authorized form of the name exists. If not, construct the name by following the authorized form pattern, and feel free to consult the departmental cataloger (?) for assistance. 


# Scope and Content Note and Abstract 
#### [DACS 3.1.](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_3/1_scope_and_content)

Wilson Library uses both the scope and content note and the abstract. The abstract often duplicates the scope and content note, particularly for small and medium size collections.  For large and complex collections, the abstract will be a distilled version of the scope and content note, which may include more details and offer more specificity about the range of material types, individuals and groups documented, geographical and chronological scope, and topics. 

The abstract identifies, summarizes, and contextualizes the collection. An effective abstract provides a general audience with concise information that they can use to determine the usefulness of the collection in answering their research questions or in making the connections they are seeking. An effective abstract suggests avenues for discovery and use of the collection materials. 

An abstract (scope and content note) should identify, summarize, and contextualize the following elements of content in a collection: 

- **People.** Individuals and groups (i.e., organizations or corporate bodies) who created or assembled the collection materials and those represented in the collection’s content. 

- **Time.** Chronological scope of the materials and the content. 

- **Place.** Geographical scope of the materials and content and non-geographical location such as “in the home.” 

- **Format and genre.** Physical and digital forms of material (e.g., photographs, audio recordings, moving images, database) and document types in relation to their purpose and content (e.g., correspondence, diaries, ledgers, zines) held in the collection. 

- **Topics.** Subject matter addressed or documented in the collection materials. 

An abstract should be brief, ideally fewer than 300 words, and should focus almost entirely on the collection materials rather than the creator or collector’s biography or organizational history.  In the past, Special Collections Technical Services archivists included a substantial amount of biographical information at the beginning of the abstract.  In current practice, the creators and collectors are briefly identified with full names, life dates or operational dates, racial or ethnic identity, and a characterization of individuals’ occupations, communities’ connections, or organization’s purpose. 

  - Roberta H. Jackson, African American professor of education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 

  - Helen Maynor Scheirbeck (1935-2010), a Lumbee Indian political scientist, educator, and community organizer born in Lumberton, N.C. 

  - William R. Ferris, white folklorist, author, professor, and filmmaker of Vicksburg, Miss. 

  - multi generational African American community with familial ties to coal mining towns in Harlan County, Ky. 

  - Latinx immigrant communities in and around Siler City, N.C. 

  - Psi Delta Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, the first historically black Greek organization established at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 

  - Southern Tenant Farmers' Union, organized at Poinsett County, Ark., in 1934, and founded as an interracial labor union for sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and agricultural workers

- The collection of organizational records, audiovisual materials, and photographs documents the Southern Folk Cultural Revival Project, an organization based in Nashville, Tenn., and founded in 1966 by African American folklorist, singer, and civil rights activist Bernice Johnson Reagon and white folklorist and folk musician Anne Romaine. The Southern Folk Cultural Revival Project (SFCRP) worked to present traditional musicians from African American and white cultures in performance together at a time when this was considered controversial. The SFCRP continued presenting musical performances throughout the South until the late 1980s, keeping close ties with the civil rights movement. 

- Albums and scrapbooks collected by Bowman Gray, Jr., of Winston-Salem, N.C., provide documentation of the First World War (1914-1918) through images created by photographers likely working for the French government or French Armée, through press coverage in clippings from the New York Times, and through printed items and ephemera reflecting the war effort on the American home front. Photograph albums contain more than 3000 captioned images taken in Europe and North Africa. Many images depict the destruction wrought by modern warfare and artillery on the villages and communes across France. The primary subject is the French Armée soldiers and officers on the front line in camps, cantonments, shelters, tunnels, and trenches before and after battles. Camp life is particularly well documented. Also pictured are colonial troops and cavalry including Spahis, Zouaves, Algerians, Moroccans, and Senegalese; troops from the countries comprising the Allies; German, Bulgarian, and Turk prisoners of war; nurses and doctors; refugees; civilians in towns, cities, schools, factories, and internment camps; wounded soldiers in the field and in hospitals; and disabled veterans "crippled" or blinded in the war. Loose images in the collection are photomechanical reproductions depicting French Armée officers and soldiers and colonial troops and cavalry. 

- This collection contains four account books, 1873-1903, of white physician A. G. Davison of Luzerne County, Pa., in which he kept records on his patients. Entries record charges for visits, prescriptions, and details of other medical care. The first volume documents that Davison had an equal partnership with white physician and druggist E. F. Kamerly in 1873. In 1874, Kamerly had three-fifths of the partnership and Davison had two-fifths. The remaining volumes do not show an apparent partnership between Davison and Kamerly. Although the first page of the third volume contains information from 1903, the rest of the volume appears to pertain to 1880-1886. 


# Extent 
#### [DACS 2.5](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/5_extent)

We record the extent or size of a collection in both item counts and tallies of linear footage. An exception is the case of z collections (collections of five folders or fewer), where only item count is listed. 

When estimating item counts, consider that a document case is said to contain about 400 one- or two-page items and a linear-foot Paige box (record center carton) is staid to contain about 800 items if the items are in legal-size folders and 1200 if they are in letter-size folders. If the box contains one or more large items, reduce the count as common sense dictates. 

The linear-foot count is even more straightforward. Linear feet are calculated according to the boxes used, whether or not these boxes are full. A Paige box is 1.5 linear feet, while a document case is 0.5 linear feet.  

Items separated (S volumes, audiovisual materials, and oversize papers) are included in item counts, but not in linear footage.  


# Restrictions
#### [DACS 4.](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/00_conditions_of_access_and_use_elements.html)
### Conditions Governing Access
In local practice, we define access as having the permission and ability to view, hear, or handle original documents or facsimiles in person and to make or receive photoduplicates for reference and research.

### Conditions Governing Use
In local practice, we define use as the permission to publish, broadcast, exhibit, display, or present a collection’s content and to receive photoduplicates for publication, broadcast, exhibit, display, and online presentation.

### General Guidelines for Restriction Statements
Restriction statements provide information about any limitations imposed on a collection’s availability for reference, research, duplication, and use. Restrictions are placed on collections by the Library or by the collection’s source (typically donor, but also seller). Wilson Library’s librarians and archivists champion open access and seek to minimize restrictions. However, we do have contractual obligations to donors, and we do recognize that preservation of original documents, which are at risk for loss, sometimes does necessitate reasonable limitations on handling.  

We record restrictions to access and restrictions to use in the finding aid in order to alert users and library staff to the limitations on a collection’s availability for reference, research, duplication, and use and to provide information about options they may have now or in the future to access and use a collection’s content.

Restriction statements should be clear and concise and should indicate all of the following: 

- Type of restriction

- Collection materials included in the restriction

- Who imposed the restriction (Library, Donor/Seller)

- Reason for the restriction if the Library imposed the restriction

- Reference to the gift agreement or other agreement if the donor/seller imposed the restriction

- Duration of the restriction

- Other options for access or use, if any

- How to obtain permission if applicable
  
The first sentence in a restriction statement should be a standardized and general statement about the type of restriction placed on the materials. This boilerplate is followed by the specific information about the restriction in relation to the collection.

# Acquisition
#### [DACS 5.1.](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_5/1_custodial_history)

Wilson Library uses the acquisition element to convey the following information. 

- Sources of the material (donor, transferring agency, seller) 

- Dates (month and year) the materials were received and added to Wilson Library’s holdings

# Citation
#### [DACS 7.1.5.](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_7/1_notes)

Wilson Special Collections provides a preferred citation format for researchers. Ultimately, researchers, writers, editors, and publishers will adjust the format for their purposes, but the citation element outlines the information needed for archivists, researchers, and others to find the archival material cited.  
All citations should contain the following information: 

- Name of the collection 

- Unique collection number 

- Repository name/Collecting unit 

- Wilson Library 

- University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 

Ideally, citations would also contain additional and specific information about items including: 

- Descriptive identification of the item  

- Date of the item 

- Container in which the item was located 

The preferred citation format is customized for each collection to suggest the syntax researchers can use in citing that collection. 

- [Identification of item], in the Eastern Kentucky Social Club Collection #5606, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  

- [Identification of item], in the Dom Flemons Papers #20427, Southern Folklife Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

- [Identification of item], in the Parachute Club of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Records #40390, University Archives, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

- [Identification of item], in the Bowman Gray Collection of First World War Photograph Albums and Scrapbooks #12024, Rare Book Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

- [Identification of item], in the Colvin M. Edwards Photographic Collection #P0116, North Carolina Collection Photographic Archives, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 


# Privacy Statement

In 2009 archivists in Special Collections Technical Services worked with the office of the University Counsel to develop a privacy statement for archival holdings in Wilson Library.  The purpose of the statement is to alert archival researchers to the likelihood that records from the recent past hold private, sensitive, and confidential information about individuals, particularly third parties who had no opportunity to consent to the release of the information. The statement refers to the relevant North Carolina statutes and regulations that protect that information and warns that disclosure of private information on the part of the researcher could have legal consequences. 

The privacy statement is included in all Wilson Library finding aids. 

_Manuscript collections and archival records may contain materials with sensitive or confidential information that is protected under federal or state right to privacy laws and regulations, the North Carolina Public Records Act (N.C.G.S. § 132 1 et seq.), and Article 7 of the North Carolina State Personnel Act (Privacy of State Employee Personnel Records, N.C.G.S. § 126-22 et seq.). Researchers are advised that the disclosure of certain information pertaining to identifiable living individuals represented in this collection without the consent of those individuals may have legal ramifications (e.g., a cause of action under common law for invasion of privacy may arise if facts concerning an individual's private life are published that would be deemed highly offensive to a reasonable person) for which the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assumes no responsibility._
