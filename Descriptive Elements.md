# Reference code
#### [DACS 2.1](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/1_reference_code)

This is a local unique identifier code. Typically, we use the collection number as this code.  

For Southern Folklife Collection, Southern Historical Collection, and University Archives collections, the code will consist of 5 numeric digits, e.g., 20460, 00517, or 40131. Z collections will have –z appended to the end of the code. 

North Carolina Collection codes will be alphanumeric and begin with ncc, and North Carolina Collection Photographic Archives collection codes will also be alphanumeric and begin with P, e.g., NCC0001 or P0081. 


# Title and date 
#### [DACS 2.3](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/3_title), [2.4](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/4_date)

The collection title contains the name of the collection creator, a collection title, and the collection’s inclusive dates. 

- **Name of collection creator:** The name of the collection creator may be a personal name, family name, organization name, or the name of a collector in the case of an intentionally assembled collection. Most often, you will use the authorized form of the name in the collection title, though there are occasional exceptions for certain personal names. The authorized form of a family name will appear in the creator entry but not in the title itself. 

- **Collection title:** The collection title is almost always “papers” for a collection composed of the papers of an individual or family. Use “records” for the records of organizations, University departments, or other corporate entities. A descriptive title is often used for intentionally assembled collections or smaller collections consisting of only one or two forms. Southern Folklife Collection collections are often given the title of “collection” at the discretion of the curator. 

- **Collection dates:** The collection’s inclusive dates, showing the earliest and latest dates of the materials, are included in the title. Dates do not have to be specific, especially at the collection level (e.g., 1940s-1970s). In some collections, you will find material from a range of years, but a large majority from a smaller range of years. For example, the Cyrus Aydlett Papers (#4907) contain material dating from 1941 through 1994, but most of the collection concerns Aydlett’s experiences during World War II and dates from 1943 through 1945. Thus, the inclusive dates of this collection are 1941-1994 and the bulk dates are 1943-1945: Cyrus Aydlett Papers, 1941-1994 (bulk 1943-1945). Occasionally a collection has a few items with dates significantly outside the range of the majority of the items. In this case the outlying date(s) may be appended to the range. For example, a collection with materials dated 1793 through 1822, but with a few items from 1988, would be listed: 1723-1822, 1988. The date of an alternate form of an item is the date the alternate form was created, not the date of the original item.  

Sample collection titles include: 

- John Messina Collection on the Charles Evers Mississippi Gubernatorial Campaign of 1971 

- Kemp Battle Nye Papers, 1930s-2000s 

- Craig, Ferris, and Flowers Family Papers, 1841-2014 

- Charles Maurice Redfern Papers, 1943-2002 (bulk 1943-1945) 

- Eastern Kentucky African American Migration Project Collection, 1927-2015 

- Order of the Golden Fleece of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Records, 1904-2019 

- Phillip G. Collins Collection on Ruey “Curley” Collins, circa 1920s-2009 

- Willa Cofield Brick School Collection (05745)

- Anderson Blanton Collection of Oral Roberts' Broadcast (20494)

- University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill American Studies 60/Folklore 195 Photographic Projects Collection (P0053)


# Creator
#### [DACS 2.6](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/6_name_of_creators)

The creator element consists of the authorized form of the creator’s name. This may be a personal name, family name, or a name of a corporate body. Consulting the [Library of Congress Name Authority File](https://authorities.loc.gov/) is a good place to start to see if an authorized form of the name exists. If not, construct the name by following the authorized form pattern, and feel free to consult the departmental cataloger (?) for assistance. 


# Scope and Content Note and Abstract 
#### [DACS 3.1.](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_3/1_scope_and_content)

Wilson Library uses both the scope and content note and the abstract. The abstract often duplicates the scope and content note, particularly for small and medium size collections.  For large and complex collections, the abstract will be a distilled version of the scope and content note, which may include more details and offer more specificity about the range of material types, individuals and groups documented, geographical and chronological scope, and topics. 

The purpose of an abstract is to suggest avenues for discovery and use of collection materials and to provide a general audience with the information they need to determine the usefulness of the collection in answering their research questions or in making the connections they are seeking. [^1] An abstract should be brief, ideally fewer than 300 words, and should focus almost entirely on the collection materials rather than the creator or collector’s biography or organizational history.  

An abstract (scope and content note) should identify, summarize, and contextualize the following elements of content in a collection: 

- **People.** Individuals and groups (i.e., organizations or corporate bodies) who created or assembled the collection materials and those represented in the collection’s content, including enslaved people whose voices typically are not heard in the collection, but whose lives nevertheless are documented. 

- **Time.** Chronological scope of the materials and the content. Life dates for creators and other key figures represented in the collection.

- **Place.** Geographical scope of the materials and content and non-geographical location such as “in the home.” Note that it is important to note plantation names linked with slavery in order to assist researchers who are doing pre 1870 African American genealogy, which leans heavily on place names to locate enslaved family members.

- **Format and genre.** Physical and digital forms of material (e.g., photographs, audio recordings, moving images, database) and document types in relation to their purpose and content (e.g., correspondence, diaries, ledgers, zines) held in the collection. Note that in trying to surface the lives of enslaved people, it is especially important to record types of legal and financial materials, such as estate papers, wills, deeds, and bills of sale, as the names of enslaved people may appear here.

- **Topics.** Subject matter addressed or documented in the collection materials. 

In addition to these core elements, we strive for conscious language and ethical description in our abstracts, both for new finding aid description and for our reparative work of legacy description (“conscious editing”). As an embodiment of the history of the Southern United States, archival collections at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill include a vast range of content that is deeply offensive and disturbing. [^2] Historically our finding aid description has centered on the creators and collectors, often white individuals or families who owned enslaved individuals. Conscious description and editing practices seek to acknowledge and present this reality clearly, to better enable researchers to engage with the detail and scope of historical evidence, and to surface voices and stories of enslaved individuals and those previously hidden in our legacy collection description.  

We aspire to re-envision our descriptive practice so that whiteness is no longer the presumed default, language is inclusive and accessible, and description does not obscure collection material that documents the lives of enslaved people. [^3] This work is influenced and inspired by the conversation happening around ethical archival description in the profession. We have based our approach on the writings and presentations by Jarrett Drake, Gloria Gonzalez, Jasmine Jones, Michelle Caswell, Annie Tang, Dorothy Berry, Kelly Bolding, Rachel Winston, Nathan Sentence, and the [Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia’s Anti-Racist Description Working Group](https://archivesforblacklives.wordpress.com/), among others. 

The remainder of this section will focus on two core descriptive elements of our department’s conscious description and editing practices in relation to the abstract. The first highlights our focus to de-center whiteness in our abstract description by identifying and characterizing individuals and groups, while the second discusses our recommendations and examples for reframing the abstract narrative away from a white and male centered narrative and towards a more inclusive description that gives voice and visibility to those documented in the collections at UNC. Please consult our [Style Guide](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Style%20Guide.md) for more on inclusive language and a list of recommended terms for ethnic and racial identities used in our description.

### Identifying and characterizing: De-centering whiteness  

In the past, Special Collections Technical Services archivists included a substantial amount of biographical information on the creator or collector at the beginning of the abstract. This legacy description often valorized the creators and collectors and hid the voices and stories of those documented in the collection, including the names of enslaved individuals and families. In current practice, the creators and collectors are briefly identified with full names, life dates or operational dates, racial or ethnic identity, and a characterization of individuals’ occupations, communities’ connections, or organization’s purpose.  

- William R. Ferris, white folklorist, author, professor, and filmmaker of Vicksburg, Miss. 

- Roberta H. Jackson, African American professor of education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 

- Helen Maynor Scheirbeck (1935-2010), a Lumbee Indian political scientist, educator, and community organizer born in Lumberton, N.C. 

- Psi Delta Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, the first historically Black Greek organization established at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 

- Southern Tenant Farmers' Union, organized at Poinsett County, Ark., in 1934, and founded as an interracial labor union for sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and agricultural workers. 

- Videotapes created by Judith McWillie, a white artist, author, and professor emeritus of drawing and painting at the Lamar Dodd School of Art in Athens, Ga. 

- The collection of organizational records, audiovisual materials, and photographs documents the Southern Folk Cultural Revival Project, an organization based in Nashville, Tenn., and founded in 1966 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, an African American folklorist, singer, and civil rights activist, and Anne Romaine, a white folklorist and folk musician. The Southern Folk Cultural Revival Project (SFCRP) worked to present traditional musicians from African American and white cultures in performance together at a time when this was considered controversial. The SFCRP continued presenting musical performances throughout the South until the late 1980s, keeping close ties with the civil rights movement. - 

As seen in the examples above, we list ethnic and racial identities to describe creators and collectors in the abstract. Previously we only included ethnic and racial identities for underrepresented racial identities, such as African Americans or Indigenous people. Since August 2017, we have described the ethnic and racial identities of all creators and collectors so that whiteness is no longer the invisible norm. When applicable, we use “white” as an ethnic and racial identity in our abstract description so that whiteness is no longer the presumed default of the people represented in our collections. We also add ethnic and racial identities to groups and organizations if identity is relevant currently or historically to the group. [^4] Please consult the [Style Guide](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Style%20Guide.md) for a list of preferred terms of racial and ethnic identities.  

This descriptive element of identifying and characterizing creators and collectors focuses on race rather than any of the other aspects of identity such as gender, sexuality, religion, or physical ability. This focus was not meant to diminish any of these aspects of identity; rather, it is a recognition that racial identity is especially significant for the collections and context at UNC-Chapel Hill. [^5] To determine identity, we rely on self-identification; other information supplied to the repository by collection creators or sources; public records, press accounts, and secondary sources; and contextual information in the collection materials. Self-identification is favored above all else. Omissions of ethnic and racial identities in finding aids created or updated after August 2017 are an indication of insufficient information to make an educated guess or an individual's preference for identity information to be excluded from description. We strongly encourage researchers, the general public, our colleagues, and those described or the descendants of those described to please let us know when we have misidentified individuals or groups.  

When appropriate, we also add racial and ethnic identities to key figures documented in the collection. This may include individuals or groups who have significant or meaningful ties to the creator or collector(s), such as a working relationship (e.g. business partners, project collaborators, interviewer/interviewee, documentarian/subject, mentor/mentee, etc) or when the collection contains a substantial amount of materials on specific individuals or groups. [^6]

- A 1990 oral history interview conducted by Molly Conrecode, a white folklorist, with Bland Simpson, a white author, playwright, songwriter, and musician, who was a member of the North Carolina string band, the Red Clay Ramblers. 

- The collection of journalist and author Paul Cuadros contains images of central North Carolina and Latinx immigrant communities in and around Siler City that were taken by Cuadros while he conducted research for his 2006 book A Home on the Field: How One Championship Team Inspires Hope for the Revival of Small Town America. 

- The Eastern Kentucky African American Migration Project (EKAAMP) is a public humanities and archival collecting initiative directed by sociologist Karida Brown in partnership with the Southern Historical Collection (SHC) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 2013, the SHC joined Brown in her efforts to document a multi-generational African American community with familial ties to coal mining towns in Harlan County, Ky. 

- A video recording of Piedmont blues guitarist, Etta Baker (1913-2006), created by white folklorists, Cecelia Conway and Elva Bishop. Etta Baker, born Etta Lucille Reid, claimed European, African American, and Native American ancestry. She grew up in Caldwell County, N.C., where she learned to play Piedmont blues, ragtime, and fiddle tunes from her father, Boone Reid. 

- This collection contains four account books, 1873-1903, of A. G. Davison, a white physician of Luzerne County, Pa., in which he kept records on his patients. Entries record charges for visits, prescriptions, and details of other medical care. The first volume documents that Davison had an equal partnership with white physician and druggist E. F. Kamerly in 1873. In 1874, Kamerly had three-fifths of the partnership and Davison had two-fifths. The remaining volumes do not show an apparent partnership between Davison and Kamerly. Although the first page of the third volume contains information from 1903, the rest of the volume appears to pertain to 1880-1886. 

- Recordings of the Rising Stars of Louisa Anniversary Program featuring the Rising Stars, a modern African American gospel quartet, performing at the St. Steven's Baptist Church in Stevensburg, Va. Included are congregational singing, solo gospel, and spirituals, religious testimonials, sung prayer with response, and shouts. Douglas Turner Day, a white folklorist who received his masters in folklore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, made the recordings, presumably as part of his masters thesis research on an African American gospel program in central Virginia. 

- The collection of African American photographer Colvin M. Edwards contains approximately 48000 images from the portrait studio he owned and operated in Charlotte, N.C. A majority of the photographs depict community members of two of Charlotte's oldest historically African American neighborhoods, Beatties Ford and Biddleville, and date from the early 1940s through the late 1960s. Also included are images depicting members of local businesses, churches, groups, and schools. 

### Reframing the Narrative: Surfacing Voices and Stories of the Enslaved   

Much of the legacy abstract description found at Wilson Special Collections Library glorifies the experiences of white individuals and groups. In the Southern Historical Collection this is most evident in our description of white antebellum southerners. While sometimes acknowledging slavery, much of the language in these finding aids centers the lives of enslavers and softens the role that white southerners played in the system of racial oppression, often obscuring the lives and lived experiences of enslaved individuals documented in the collection. More generally, our legacy description leans towards a white (often white supremacist), male, straight, and able-bodied perspective. We strive to actively reframe this narrative for both new finding aids and our conscious editing of legacy description. We do this by calling out racist actions and viewpoints and by purposefully calling out the lives and voices of those historically left out in our legacy description. We do this to make our description more inclusive and accessible and to better enable researchers to engage with the detail and scope of historical evidence. 

Please consult the [Style Guide](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/TS-Archival-Procedures-Manual/blob/master/Style%20Guide.md) for more on conscious language and the voice and style of inclusive description. Below are examples of our efforts to remediate legacy description to reframe the narrative and surface the voices of those previously left out of our description. 

- **Example 1**  

*Legacy description:*

The F. W. Tuttle Collection of Papers documents financial transactions concerning enslaved people, land, and other goods of the Harper family and others. 

*Edited description:* 

The Frank W. Tuttle Collection of Papers documents enslaved people, land, and other goods as financial transactions of the Harper family and others. 

- **Example 2** 

*Legacy description:* 

Thomas Francis Price was a farmer from Rutherford County, N.C., serving in the 56th North Carolina Volunteers. He was married to Sarah Harrill Price. 

*Edited description:* 

Thomas Francis Price and Sarah Harrill Price were married white farmers from Rutherford County, N.C. Thomas Francis Price served in the 56th North Carolina Infantry. 

- **Example 3**  

*Legacy description:*

Prudhomme family members were planters in Natchitoches Parish, La., with interests in slaves, cotton, corn, hay, lumber, livestock, and a general store. Six generations of Prudhommes, spanning the 19th and 20th centuries, lived at Bermuda plantation (later called Oakland). Among the important members of the Prudhomme family were Phanor Prudhomme (1807-1865); his son, J. Alphonse Prudhomme I (1838-1919); his grandson, P. Phanor Prudhomme II (1865-1948); and his great grandson, J. Alphonse Prudhomme II (1896-1991), who carried on the various agricultural operations and the general store until the early 1980s; and J. Alphonse II's wife, Lucile Keator Prudhomme (1906-1994). 

*Edited description:*

The Prudhomme family of Natchitoches Parish, La., were the French Creole owners of a plantation based on a workforce of enslaved people and later tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and day laborers, with interests in cotton, corn, hay, lumber, livestock, and a general store. Six generations of Prudhommes and enslaved people and their descendants, spanning the 19th and 20th centuries, lived at Bermuda plantation (later called Oakland). 

- **Example 4** 

*Legacy description:*

Tunstall Family Letter, 1850 
Whitmell P. (Pugh) Tunstall was born in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. He was educated at Danville Academy and the University of North Carolina. Tunstall served in the Virginia General Assembly in both houses. He was a delegate in the House of Delegates from 1836 to 1841, a senator in the State Senate in 1841 and 1842, and a delegate again from 1845 to 1848. Tunstall was a proponent of railroads and in 1838 introduced a bill to charter the Richmond and Danville (R&D) Railroad. A charter was granted for the R&D Railroad in 1847. He was married to Mary Tunstall and they had a daughter, Mary Ellen. Whitmell P. Tunstall died in 1854 of typhoid fever, two years prior to the railroad's completion. The collection is a letter from Mrs. Mary Tunstall in Danville, Va., to her husband, Whitmell P. Tunstall, in Richmond, Va., dated 25 January 1850 in which she acknowledges receipt of his gift of a female slave child and relates her satisfaction with the child in terms of skin color and sewing capabilities. 

*Edited description:*

Mary Tunstall Letter on Enslaved Child Betsy, 1850 
The collection is a letter dated 25 January 1850 about Betsy an enslaved African American female child. Written by white Virginian Mary Tunstall from Danville, Va., to her husband white Virginia politician Whitmell P. Tunstall (1810-1854), in Richmond, Va., the letter describes the color of Betsy's skin, her sewing skills, and suitability for working in the home from the perspective of Betsy's enslaver. 


# Extent 
#### [DACS 2.5](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_2/5_extent)

We record the extent or size of a collection in both item counts and tallies of linear footage. An exception is the case of z collections (collections of five folders or fewer), where only item count is listed. 

When estimating item counts, consider that a document case is said to contain about 400 one- or two-page items and a linear-foot Paige box (record center carton) is staid to contain about 800 items if the items are in legal-size folders and 1200 if they are in letter-size folders. If the box contains one or more large items, reduce the count as common sense dictates. 

The linear-foot count is even more straightforward. Linear feet are calculated according to the boxes used, whether or not these boxes are full. A Paige box is 1.5 linear feet, while a document case is 0.5 linear feet.  

Items separated (S volumes, audiovisual materials, and oversize papers) are included in item counts, but not in linear footage. 

Items separated EXAMPLE:

    Oversize papers (OPF-20450/1-8, XOPF-20450/1-2)
    Audiocassettes (FS-20450/1-771)
    Audiotape (FT-20450/1-143)
    Digital Audiotape (DAT-20450/1-8)
    Videotape (VT-20450/1-68)

Additionally, we record a quantitative measurement of processed digital content in an Extent statement. This measurement should be recorded separately from any Extent statement(s) for physical material. At minimum, record the extent of digital content in gigabytes (GB). Optionally, record the number of digital files. 

Extent EXAMPLES:

_HYBRID ANALOG AND BORN-DIGITAL COLLECTION_:

    Extent: 27.5 feet of linear shelf space (approximately 5,000 items); 27 GB (4,825 digital files)

_ENTIRELY DIGITAL COLLECTION_:

    Extent: 27 GB (4,825 digital files)

# Restrictions
#### [DACS 4.](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/00_conditions_of_access_and_use_elements.html)
### Conditions Governing Access
In local practice, we define access as having the permission and ability to view, hear, or handle original documents or facsimiles in person and to make or receive photoduplicates for reference and research.

### Conditions Governing Use
In local practice, we define use as the permission to publish, broadcast, exhibit, display, or present a collection’s content and to receive photoduplicates for publication, broadcast, exhibit, display, and online presentation.

This is the copyright statement we use in our finding aids:

_Copyright is retained by the authors of items in these papers, or their descendants, as stipulated by United States copyright law._

> Note: copyright does not apply to records in University Archives, since they are public records. 

### General Guidelines for Restriction Statements
Restriction statements provide information about any limitations imposed on a collection’s availability for reference, research, duplication, and use. Restrictions are placed on collections by the Library or by the collection’s source (typically donor, but also seller). Wilson Library’s librarians and archivists champion open access and seek to minimize restrictions. However, we do have contractual obligations to donors, and we do recognize that preservation of original documents, which are at risk for loss, sometimes does necessitate reasonable limitations on handling.  

We record restrictions to access and restrictions to use in the finding aid in order to alert users and library staff to the limitations on a collection’s availability for reference, research, duplication, and use and to provide information about options they may have now or in the future to access and use a collection’s content.

Restriction statements should be clear and concise and should indicate all of the following: 

- Type of restriction

- Collection materials included in the restriction

- Who imposed the restriction (Library, Donor/Seller)

- Reason for the restriction if the Library imposed the restriction

- Reference to the gift agreement or other agreement if the donor/seller imposed the restriction

- Duration of the restriction

- Other options for access or use, if any

- How to obtain permission if applicable
  
The first sentence in a restriction statement should be a standardized and general statement about the type of restriction placed on the materials. This boilerplate is followed by the specific information about the restriction in relation to the collection.

# Citation
#### [DACS 7.1.5.](https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_7/1_notes)

Wilson Special Collections provides a preferred citation format for researchers. Ultimately, researchers, writers, editors, and publishers will adjust the format for their purposes, but the citation element outlines the information needed for archivists, researchers, and others to find the archival material cited.  
All citations should contain the following information: 

- Name of the collection 

- Unique collection number 

- Repository name/Collecting unit 

- Wilson Library 

- University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 

Ideally, citations would also contain additional and specific information about items including: 

- Descriptive identification of the item  

- Date of the item 

- Container in which the item was located 

The preferred citation format is customized for each collection to suggest the syntax researchers can use in citing that collection. 

- [Identification of item], in the Eastern Kentucky Social Club Collection #5606, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  

- [Identification of item], in the Dom Flemons Papers #20427, Southern Folklife Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

# Privacy Statement

In 2009 archivists in Special Collections Technical Services worked with the office of the University Counsel to develop a privacy statement for archival holdings in Wilson Library.  The purpose of the statement is to alert archival researchers to the likelihood that records from the recent past hold private, sensitive, and confidential information about individuals, particularly third parties who had no opportunity to consent to the release of the information. The statement refers to the relevant North Carolina statutes and regulations that protect that information and warns that disclosure of private information on the part of the researcher could have legal consequences. 

The privacy statement is included in all Wilson Library finding aids. 

_Manuscript collections and archival records may contain materials with sensitive or confidential information that is protected under federal or state right to privacy laws and regulations, the North Carolina Public Records Act (N.C.G.S. § 132 1 et seq.), and Article 7 of the North Carolina State Personnel Act (Privacy of State Employee Personnel Records, N.C.G.S. § 126-22 et seq.). Researchers are advised that the disclosure of certain information pertaining to identifiable living individuals represented in this collection without the consent of those individuals may have legal ramifications (e.g., a cause of action under common law for invasion of privacy may arise if facts concerning an individual's private life are published that would be deemed highly offensive to a reasonable person) for which the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assumes no responsibility._

_The revised finding aid compiles archival collecting, description, and preservation work performed by:_

#### We use this statement to acknowledge ethnic and racial identities for individuals and families represented in collections:
_Since August 2017, we have added ethnic and racial identities for individuals and families represented in collections. To determine identity, we rely on self-identification; other information supplied to the repository by collection creators or sources; public records, press accounts, and secondary sources; and contextual information in the collection materials. Omissions of ethnic and racial identities in finding aids created or updated after August 2017 are an indication of insufficient information to make an educated guess or an individual's preference for identity information to be excluded from description. When we have misidentified, please let us know at <wilsonlibrary@unc.edu>._
